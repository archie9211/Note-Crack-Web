## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for a **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** deployment on **Cloudflare**.

- The `astro.config.mjs` file is set up with `output: 'server'` and the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter.
- The easiest way to deploy is to link your GitHub repository directly to Cloudflare Pages, which will automatically detect the Astro configuration.
- To build the project for a manual production deployment, run:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
     This will generate the `dist/` directory containing the `_worker.js` entry point required by Cloudflare.
