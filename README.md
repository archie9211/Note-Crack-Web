## ‚ú® Core Features

This isn't just a simple static site. It's a full-featured web application packed with modern tools to enhance the user experience.

- **üöÄ Blazing Fast Performance:** Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) for a static-first, zero-JavaScript-by-default architecture. Pages are incredibly lightweight and load instantly.

- **üì± Progressive Web App (PWA):** Fully installable on both desktop and mobile for an app-like experience.

     - **Complete Offline Support:** A custom service worker aggressively caches all visited notes, static assets, and even the search index, making the app fully functional without an internet connection.
     - **Smart Update Prompts:** Users are notified with a toast pop-up when new content is available and can reload the app to get the latest version.

- **üîé Client-Side Fuzzy Search:**

     - Lightweight and instant search of note **titles and descriptions** for maximum relevance.
     - Powered by [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/), a powerful fuzzy-search library.
     - A simple JSON index is generated at build time, keeping the client-side footprint small.

- **üìñ Distraction-Free Reading Experience:**

     - A clean, three-column layout on desktop: **Navigation | Article | Table of Contents**.
     - Fully responsive design that refactors into a focused, single-column view on mobile.
     - **Auto-hiding navigation bars** on scroll to maximize reading space.
     - **Reading Progress Bar** at the top of the page.
     - **Page Load Progress Bar** ([NProgress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress)) for instant feedback on navigation.
     - Convenient **Next/Previous Article** navigation links.

- **‚úçÔ∏è Content as Code:**

     - Notes are written in simple **Markdown** using Astro's type-safe [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).
     - Organized by `subject > class > topic` for a clear and scalable information architecture.

- **üé® Theming:**

     - Light and Dark mode support with a manual toggle.
     - Persists user preference in `localStorage` and prevents FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content).

- **‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Ready:**
     - Configured for **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.
     - Optimized for deployment on the **Cloudflare Workers** platform.
- ** CMS - TinaCMS
     - Currently broken but is planned for in future. We might also add some other CMS if suited.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for a **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** deployment on **Cloudflare Workers**.

- The `astro.config.mjs` file is set up with `output: 'server'` and the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter.
- The `wrangler.toml` file (if you choose to use it for direct deployment) should be configured to point to the `dist/_worker.js` entry point.
- To build the project for production, run:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
     This will generate the `dist/` directory, which can be deployed to Cloudflare.
