              - "Vomiting"
              - "Indigestion"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Anxiety and eating spicy food together in an otherwise normal human may lead to indigestion . Stress can affect digestive processes, and spicy foods can irritate the digestive lining, leading to symptoms of indigestion."

      - text: "Where do certains symbiotic microorganisms normally occur in human body ?"
        options:
              - "Caecum"
              - "Oral lining and tongue surface"
              - "Vermiform appendix and rectum"
              - "Duodenum"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Certain symbiotic microorganisms normally occur in the human body, particularly in the caecum . The caecum is a part of the large intestine where significant microbial activity, including fermentation, takes place."

      - text: "Select the correct match of the digested products in humans given in column I with their absorption site and mechanism in column II."
        options:
              - "Fructose, Na+ small intestine, passive absorption"
              - "Glycerol, fatty acids duodenum, move as chilomicrons"
              - "Cholesterol, maltose large intestine, active absorption"
              - "Glycine, glucose small intestine, active absorption"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The correct match is Glycine, glucose – small intestine, active absorption . Glycine (an amino acid) and glucose are primarily absorbed in the small intestine, largely through active transport mechanisms . Fructose is absorbed by facilitated transport , not passive. Glycerol and fatty acids are absorbed by lymph vessels/lacteals  and move as chylomicrons. Maltose is digested to glucose before absorption, typically in the small intestine, not the large intestine."

      - text: "Fructose is absorbed into the blood through mucosa cells of intestine by the process called:"
        options:
              - "simple diffusion"
              - "co-transport mechanism"
              - "active transport"
              - "facilitated transport"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Fructose is absorbed into the blood through mucosa cells of the intestine by the process called facilitated transport . This process involves specific carrier proteins in the cell membrane that assist the movement of fructose down its concentration gradient, without direct energy expenditure."

      - text: "The initial step in the digestion of milk in humans is carried out by?"
        options:
              - "Rennin"
              - "Pepsin"
              - "Lipase"
              - "Trypsin"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The initial step in the digestion of milk in humans is carried out by Rennin . Rennin (chymosin) is an enzyme found in the gastric juice of infants  that causes the coagulation of milk proteins, preparing them for further digestion."

      - text: "Which of the following statements is not correct?"
        options:
              - "Goblet cells are present in the mucosa of intestine and secrete mucus"
              - "Oxyntic cells are present in the mucosa of stomach and secrete HCl."
              - "Acini are present in the pancreas and secrete carboxypeptidase"
              - "Brunner's glands are present in the submucosa of stomach and secrete pepsinogen"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The statement that is not correct is: Brunner's glands are present in the submucosa of stomach and secrete pepsinogen . Brunner's glands are located in the submucosa of the duodenum . Pepsinogen is secreted by chief cells (peptic cells) in the stomach . The other statements are correct based on the sources: Goblet cells secrete mucus in the intestine ; Oxyntic cells (Parietal cells) secrete HCl in the stomach ; and Acini (pancreatic acinar cells) in the pancreas secrete enzymes like carboxypeptidase ."

      - text: "Gastric juice of infants contains : "
        options:
              - "nuclease, pepsinogen, lipase"
              - "pepsinogen, lipase, rennin"
              - "amylase, rennin, pepsinogen"
              - "maltase, pepsinogen, rennin"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Gastric juice of infants contains pepsinogen, lipase, and rennin . Pepsinogen is for protein digestion, lipase for fat digestion, and rennin for milk coagulation."

      - text: "The active form of Entamoeba histolytica feeds upon"
        options:
              - "mucosa and submucosa of colon only"
              - "food in intestine"
              - "blood only"
              - "erythrocytes; mucosa and submucosa of colon"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The active form of Entamoeba histolytica feeds upon erythrocytes; mucosa and submucosa of colon . This parasite causes amoebiasis and invades the lining of the large intestine and consumes red blood cells."

      - text: "The guts of cow and buffalo posses"
        options:
              - "Chlorella spp."
              - "Methanogens"
              - "Cyanobacteria"
              - "Fucus spp."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The guts of cow and buffalo (ruminants) possess methanogens . These anaerobic microorganisms are crucial for the digestion of cellulose and the production of methane as a byproduct in the ruminant digestive system. Symbiotic microorganisms are also found in the caecum ."
