              - "Breaking down complex organic matter"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Green plants are called autotrophs because they make or synthesise the food they need through photosynthesis, and all other organisms depend on them for their needs."

      - text: "Photosynthesis is considered crucial for life on Earth for which two primary reasons?"
        options:
              - "It releases nitrogen and produces proteins."
              - "It is the primary source of all food and releases oxygen into the atmosphere."

              - "It regulates plant growth hormones and purifies soil."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it is the primary source of all food on Earth, and it is also responsible for the release of oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants."

      - text: "Which simple experiment demonstrates that chlorophyll (green pigment) is required for photosynthesis to occur?"
        options:
              - "Placing a burning candle and a mouse in a sealed bell jar with a mint plant."
              - "Enclosing a part of a leaf in a test tube with KOH-soaked cotton."
              - "Exposing a variegated leaf (or partially covered with black paper) to light and testing for starch."
              - "Using a prism to split light and illuminate a green alga with aerobic bacteria."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The experiment to look for starch formation in two leaves – a variegated leaf or a leaf that was partially covered with black paper, and exposed to light – showed that photosynthesis occurred only in the green parts of the leaves in the presence of light."

      - text: "Joseph Priestley's experiment in 1770, involving a burning candle, a mouse, and a mint plant in a bell jar, led him to hypothesise that:"
        options:
              - "Animals require oxygen for survival."
              - "Burning candles produce carbon dioxide."
              - "Plants consume carbon dioxide from the air."
              - "Plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove."
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Priestley observed that a burning candle or an animal that breathes both somehow damage the air. But when he placed a mint plant in the same bell jar, the mouse stayed alive and the candle continued to burn, leading him to hypothesise that plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove."

        options:
              - "Plants only grow in the dark."
              - "Sunlight is essential for the plant process that purifies air."
              - "Non-green parts of plants can release oxygen."
              - "Plants primarily release carbon dioxide in light."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Ingenhousz showed that sunlight is essential for the plant process that somehow purifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals. He also showed that it is only the green part of the plants that could release oxygen."

              - "Glucose is produced and stored as protein; chlorophyll is in the nucleus."
              - "Glucose is produced and stored as starch; chlorophyll is located in special bodies (chloroplasts)."
              - "Glucose is produced and stored as lipids; chlorophyll is in the cell wall."
              - "Glucose is produced and stored as sucrose; chlorophyll is distributed throughout the cytoplasm."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells."

      - text: "T.W. Engelmann's experiment, using a prism and aerobic bacteria with Cladophora alga, helped describe the first action spectrum of photosynthesis. He observed that bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of:"

      - text: "The microbiologist Cornelius van Niel demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction where hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. His inference about the source of oxygen evolved by green plants was:"
        options:
              - "It comes from carbon dioxide."
              - "It comes from the oxidisable compound (e.g., H2S)."
              - "It comes from water (H2O)."
              - "It comes from atmospheric oxygen."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Based on his studies, van Niel inferred that the O2 evolved by the green plant comes from H2O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using radioisotopic techniques."

      - text: "The overall balanced chemical equation representing photosynthesis, incorporating the understanding that O2 is released from water, is:"
        options:
              - "CO2 + H2O → [CH2O] + O2"
              - "6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2"
              - "6CO2 + 12H2O → C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2"
              - "C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The correct equation, that would represent the overall process of photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 12H2O → C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2, where the O2 released is from water."

      - text: "In higher plants, the primary site for photosynthesis is the mesophyll cells within the leaves. Within these cells, chloroplasts align themselves along the walls to:"
        options:
              - "Prevent water loss"
              - "Minimise light absorption"
              - "Optimise light quantity received"
              - "Facilitate gaseous exchange"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The chloroplasts align themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the optimum quantity of the incident light."

              - "Carbon dioxide fixation; oxygen release"
              - "Water splitting; electron transport system"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The membrane system is responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH (light reactions). In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar."

      - text: "Dark reactions (carbon reactions) in photosynthesis are named so because:"
        options:
              - "They only occur in complete darkness."
              - "They are not directly light-driven but depend on the products of light reactions."
              - "They are inhibited by light."
              - "They involve the fixation of carbon, which is a 'dark' element."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The dark reactions are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called, by convention, as dark reactions (carbon reactions). However, this should not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not light-dependent."

      - text: "Paper chromatography of leaf pigments reveals four main types. Which of the following correctly matches the pigment with its characteristic colour in the chromatogram?"
        options:
              - "Chlorophyll a - yellow green"
              - "Chlorophyll b - bright or blue green"

              - "Only transferring energy to chlorophyll a."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Though chlorophyll a is the major pigment responsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll b, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments, also absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they not only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised for photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation."

              - "Xanthophylls"
              - "RuBisCO"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "In photosystem II the reaction centre chlorophyll a absorbs 680 nm wavelength of red light causing electrons to become excited and jump into an orbit farther from the atomic nucleus. These electrons are picked up by an electron acceptor which passes them to an electrons transport system consisting of cytochromes."

      - text: "The process of splitting water molecules is associated with which photosystem, and where does it physically occur?"
        options:
              - "PS I; outer side of the thylakoid membrane"
              - "PS II; inner side of the thylakoid membrane"
              - "PS I; stroma lamellae"
              - "PS II; stroma of the chloroplast"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The splitting of water is associated with the PS II; water is split into 2H+, [O] and electrons. The water splitting complex is associated with the PS II, which itself is physically located on the inner side of the membrane of the thylakoid."

      - text: "What are the key products of non-cyclic photophosphorylation, where both Photosystem I and Photosystem II work in series?"
        options:
              - "Only ATP"

              - "Both ATP and NADPH + H+"
              - "Glucose and CO2"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "When the two photosystems work in a series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. Both ATP and NADPH + H+ are synthesised by this kind of electron flow."

      - text: "Cyclic photophosphorylation primarily occurs when only Photosystem I (PS I) is functional. This process mainly leads to the synthesis of:"
        options:
              - "ATP and NADPH"
              - "NADPH + H+ only"
              - "ATP only"
              - "Oxygen and water"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "When only PS I is functional, the electron is circulated within the photosystem and the phosphorylation occurs due to cyclic flow of electrons. The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP, but not of NADPH + H+."

      - text: "According to the chemiosmotic hypothesis for ATP synthesis in chloroplasts, where do protons (hydrogen ions) accumulate, creating a gradient for ATP production?"
        options:
              - "In the stroma"
              - "In the intermembrane space"

        correct: 3
        explanation: "Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle where CO2 is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP. This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation of two molecules of 3-PGA, more correctly called RuBisCO."

      - text: "For every CO2 molecule entering the Calvin cycle, how many molecules of ATP and NADPH are required respectively?"
        options:

              - "Lack of Kranz anatomy."
              - "Higher productivity of biomass and tolerance to higher temperatures."
        correct: 3
        explanation: "C4 plants are special: They have a special type of leaf anatomy (Kranz), they tolerate higher temperatures, they show a response to high light intensities, they lack a process called photorespiration and have greater productivity of biomass."

      - text: "Kranz anatomy, a distinctive feature of C4 plants, involves:"
        options:
              - "Loosely arranged mesophyll cells throughout the leaf."
              - "Large, thick-walled bundle sheath cells forming layers around vascular bundles, rich in chloroplasts and impervious to gaseous exchange."
              - "Absence of vascular bundles in the leaves."
              - "Chloroplasts present only in the mesophyll cells, not in bundle sheath cells."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The particularly large cells around the vascular bundles of the C4 plants are called bundle sheath cells, and the leaves which have such anatomy are said to have ‘Kranz’ anatomy. These cells may form several layers around the vascular bundles; they are characterised by having a large number of chloroplasts, thick walls impervious to gaseous exchange and no intercellular spaces."

      - text: "In the Hatch and Slack Pathway (C4 pathway), where does the initial carbon dioxide fixation occur, and what enzyme catalyses this reaction?"
        options:
              - "Bundle sheath cells; RuBisCO"
              - "Mesophyll cells; PEP carboxylase (PEPcase)"
              - "Bundle sheath cells; PEP carboxylase (PEPcase)"
              - "Mesophyll cells; RuBisCO"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The primary CO2 acceptor is phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and is present in the mesophyll cells. The enzyme responsible for this fixation is PEP carboxylase or PEPcase. It is important to register that the mesophyll cells lack RuBisCO enzyme."

      - text: "In C4 plants, the Calvin pathway (C3 cycle) takes place exclusively in which type of cells?"
        options:
              - "Mesophyll cells"
              - "Epidermal cells"
              - "Bundle sheath cells"
              - "Guard cells"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In the C4 plants, the Calvin pathway does not take place in the mesophyll cells but does so only in the bundle sheath cells."

      - text: "RuBisCO, the enzyme central to the Calvin cycle, has the unique characteristic of being able to bind to both CO2 and O2. When the CO2:O2 ratio is nearly equal, RuBisCO exhibits a much greater affinity for:"
        options:
              - "Oxygen"
              - "Carbon dioxide"
              - "Both equally"
              - "Neither"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO2 when the CO2:O2 is nearly equal. This binding is competitive."

      - text: "Photorespiration occurs in C3 plants when O2 binds to RuBisCO instead of CO2. This pathway is considered wasteful because it:"
        options:
              - "Synthesises a large amount of ATP and NADPH."
              - "Produces sugars efficiently even in low light."
              - "Results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP, without synthesizing sugars or ATP/NADPH."
              - "Increases overall plant productivity."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP. Rather it results in the release of CO2 with the utilisation of ATP. In the photorespiratory pathway there is no synthesis of ATP or NADPH."

      - text: "C4 plants effectively avoid photorespiration because they have a mechanism that:"
        options:
              - "Eliminates the RuBisCO enzyme entirely."
              - "Only performs cyclic photophosphorylation."
              - "Increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site in bundle sheath cells, ensuring RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase."
              - "Keeps stomata open at all times to maximise CO2 intake."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In C4 plants photorespiration does not occur. This is because they have a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 at the enzyme site. This takes place when the C4 acid from the mesophyll is broken down in the bundle sheath cells to release CO2 – this results in increasing the intracellular concentration of CO2. In turn, this ensures that the RuBisCO functions as a carboxylase minimising the oxygenase activity."

      - text: "According to Blackman's (1905) Law of Limiting Factors, if a chemical process like photosynthesis is affected by more than one factor, its rate will be determined by the factor which is:"
        options:
              - "Most abundant in the environment."
              - "Nearest to its optimal value."
              - "Present in the highest concentration."
              - "Nearest to its minimal value."
        correct: 3
        explanation: "If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed."

      - text: "Light saturation in photosynthesis, where the rate does not increase further despite increased light intensity, typically occurs at what percentage of full sunlight?"

      - text: "Which environmental factor is considered the major limiting factor for photosynthesis in the atmosphere due to its very low concentration (between 0.03 and 0.04 percent)?"
        options:
              - "Light intensity"
              - "Water availability"
              - "Carbon dioxide concentration"
              - "Temperature"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Carbon dioxide is the major limiting factor for photosynthesis. The concentration of CO2 is very low in the atmosphere (between 0.03 and 0.04 per cent)."

      - text: "At high light intensities, how do C3 and C4 plants differ in their response to increasing CO2 concentration?"
        options:
              - "Both C3 and C4 plants show saturation at the same CO2 level (~360 µlL-1)."
              - "C3 plants show saturation at about 360 µlL-1, while C4 plants continue to respond to increased CO2."
              - "C4 plants show saturation at about 360 µlL-1, while C3 plants respond to increased CO2 concentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450 µlL-1."
              - "Neither C3 nor C4 plants respond to high CO2 conditions."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "At high light intensities, C4 plants show saturation at about 360 µlL-1 while C3 responds to increased CO2 concentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450 µlL-1. Thus, current availability of CO2 levels is limiting to the C3 plants."

      - text: "How does water stress primarily affect the rate of photosynthesis in plants?"
        options:
              - "It directly inhibits the enzymes of the light reaction."
              - "It causes stomata to close, thereby reducing the availability of CO2."
              - "It increases the rate of photorespiration, reducing efficiency."
              - "It leads to the breakdown of chlorophyll molecules."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Water stress causes the stomata to close hence reducing the CO2 availability. Besides, water stress also makes leaves wilt, thus, reducing the surface area of the leaves and their metabolic activity as well."

      - text: "Which component of the Z scheme is responsible for the splitting of water molecules to release oxygen, protons, and electrons?"
        options:
              - "Photosystem I (PS I)"
              - "Photosystem II (PS II)"
              - "Electron transport chain (ETS)"
              - "NADP reductase enzyme"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The electrons that were moved from photosystem II must be replaced. This is achieved by electrons available due to splitting of water. The splitting of water is associated with the PS II; water is split into 2H+, [O] and electrons."

      - text: "The NADP reductase enzyme, crucial for the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH + H+ in the light reaction, is located on which side of the thylakoid membrane?"
        options:
              - "The lumen side"
              - "The inner side"
              - "The stroma side"
              - "Embedded within the membrane"
        correct: 2

              - "NADP reductase, involved in NADPH synthesis."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO2 and O2 – hence the name."

      - text: "What is the primary reason for cyclic photophosphorylation to occur in plants?"
        options:
              - "To produce equal amounts of ATP and NADPH."
              - "To provide additional electrons for Photosystem II."
              - "To primarily generate more ATP, which is required in higher amounts than NADPH for the Calvin cycle."
              - "To release excess oxygen from the chloroplast."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "For every CO2 molecule entering the Calvin cycle, 3 molecules of ATP and 2 of NADPH are required. It is probably to meet this difference in number of ATP and NADPH used in the dark reaction that the cyclic phosphorylation takes place. Cyclic photophosphorylation only results in ATP synthesis."

      - text: "Which set of processes correctly describes the light reactions (photochemical phase) of photosynthesis?"

              - "Glycolysis, Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Light reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase include light absorption, water splitting, oxygen release, and the formation of high-energy chemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH."

      - text: "The primary acceptor of the electron in Photosystem I (PS I), after excitation by 700 nm light, transfers electrons downhill to which molecule for reduction?"
        options:
              - "Cytochrome b6f complex"
              - "Plastoquinone"
              - "NADP+"
              - "Water"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Electrons in the reaction centre of PS I are excited when they receive red light of wavelength 700 nm and are transferred to another accepter molecule that has a greater redox potential. These electrons then are moved downhill again, this time to a molecule of energy-rich NADP+. The addition of these electrons reduces NADP+ to NADPH + H+."

      - text: "If a plant had high concentrations of chlorophyll b but lacked chlorophyll a, would it be able to carry out photosynthesis, and why do plants have accessory pigments like chlorophyll b?"
        options:
              - "Yes, because chlorophyll b can act as the primary pigment; it broadens the light spectrum utilised."
              - "No, because chlorophyll a is the chief pigment; accessory pigments help utilise a wider range of wavelengths and protect chlorophyll a."
              - "Yes, but only in green light; accessory pigments absorb excess light."
              - "No, because chlorophyll b is an inhibitor; accessory pigments are for colouration only."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Though chlorophyll is the major pigment responsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll b, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments, also absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they not only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised for photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation. Without chlorophyll a, even if chlorophyll b absorbs light, the energy cannot be funnelled to a reaction center for the primary photochemical event. (The explanation in the source implies chlorophyll a is essential as the reaction centre)."
