      - text: "According to the classical definition, hormones are chemical messengers produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood. What is the key characteristic that distinguishes the current scientific definition of hormones from the classical one?"
        options:
              - "They are exclusively protein-based molecules."
              - "They act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts."
              - "They must be transported to a distantly located target organ."

      - text: "After ovulation, the ruptured ovarian follicle is converted into a structure that mainly secretes progesterone. What is this structure called?"
        options:
              - "Graafian follicle"
              - "Corpus albicans"
              - "Corpus luteum"
              - "Ovarian stroma"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "After ovulation, the **ruptured follicle is converted to a structure called corpus luteum, which secretes mainly progesterone**."

      - text: "Which of the following is NOT a primary action of estrogens in females?"
        options:
              - "Stimulation of growth of female secondary sex organs."
              - "Development of growing ovarian follicles."
              - "Supporting pregnancy and stimulating milk secretion."
              - "Appearance of female secondary sex characters like high pitch of voice."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "**Estrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth and activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing ovarian follicles, appearance of female secondary sex characters (e.g., high pitch of voice, etc.) and mammary gland development. Estrogens also regulate female sexual behaviour**. **Progesterone supports pregnancy** and stimulates milk secretion."

      - text: "The atrial wall of the human heart secretes a peptide hormone that plays a role in regulating blood pressure. What is this hormone called, and how does it affect blood pressure?"
        options:
              - "Angiotensin II; increases blood pressure."
              - "Erythropoietin; stimulates RBC formation."
              - "Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF); decreases blood pressure by causing vasodilation."
              - "Renin; converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The **atrial wall of our heart secretes a very important peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), which decreases blood pressure. When blood pressure is increased, ANF is secreted which causes dilation of the blood vessels. This reduces the blood pressure**."

      - text: "The juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney produce a peptide hormone that stimulates the formation of red blood cells. What is this hormone?"
        options:
              - "Renin"
              - "Aldosterone"
              - "Erythropoietin"
              - "Vasopressin"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The **juxtaglomerular cells of kidney produce a peptide hormone called erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of RBC)**."

      - text: "Which of the following statements correctly describe the actions of hormones secreted by the gastro-intestinal tract?"
        options:
              - "Gastrin stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen."
              - "Secretin stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice."
              - "Cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates the secretion of water and bicarbonate ions from the pancreas."
              - "Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP) inhibits gastric secretion and motility."
        correct: [0, 3]
        explanation: "**Gastrin acts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen**. **Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions**. **CCK acts on both pancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice**, respectively. **GIP inhibits gastric secretion and motility**."

      - text: "Hormones produce their effects by binding to specific proteins called hormone receptors. Where can these receptors be located?"
        options:
              - "Only on the cell membrane of target cells."
              - "Only inside the target cell (intracellular/nuclear)."
              - "Both on the cell membrane and inside the target cell."
              - "Within the blood plasma, binding to carrier proteins."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "**Hormone receptors present on the cell membrane of the target cells are called membrane-bound receptors and the receptors present inside the target cell are called intracellular receptors, mostly nuclear receptors (present in the nucleus)**."

      - text: "Regarding the specificity of hormone receptors, which statement is true?"
        options:
              - "Each receptor can bind to multiple types of hormones, depending on concentration."
              - "Each receptor is specific to one hormone only."
              - "Receptor specificity changes based on the target tissue."
              - "Hormone receptors are non-specific and bind to any circulating chemical messenger."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "**Each receptor is specific to one hormone only and hence receptors are specific**."

      - text: "Hormones that interact with membrane-bound receptors typically do not enter the target cell. How do they regulate cellular metabolism?"
        options:
              - "By directly altering gene expression."
              - "By forming a hormone-receptor complex that activates an enzyme cascade directly."
              - "By generating secondary messengers like cyclic AMP, IP3, or Ca^2+."
              - "By binding directly to the cell's DNA."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "**Hormones which interact with membrane-bound receptors normally do not enter the target cell, but generate second messengers (e.g., cyclic AMP, IP3, Ca^2+ etc) which in turn regulate cellular metabolism**."

      - text: "Steroid hormones and iodothyronines are examples of hormones that interact with intracellular receptors. What is their primary mechanism of action?"
        options:
              - "Generating second messengers to regulate cellular metabolism."
              - "Directly affecting the permeability of the cell membrane to ions."
              - "Regulating gene expression or chromosome function by interacting with the genome."
              - "Initiating a rapid cascade of protein phosphorylation."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "**Hormones which interact with intracellular receptors (e.g., steroid hormones, iodothyronines, etc.) mostly regulate gene expression or chromosome function by the interaction of hormone-receptor complex with the genome**."

      - text: "Based on their chemical nature, hormones are classified. Which of the following is an example of a steroid hormone?"
        options:
              - "Insulin"
