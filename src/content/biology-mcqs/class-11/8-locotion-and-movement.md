              - "Myosin"
              - "Tropomyosin"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Tropomyosin is a regulatory protein that, along with troponin, is associated with the actin filaments. It acts to block the myosin-binding sites on actin in a relaxed muscle, thus regulating contraction. While the double-chain structure is a characteristic feature of tropomyosin, its regulatory role is emphasized in the source."

        options:
              - "All or none rule"
              - "Tetanus"
              - "Threshold stimulus"
              - "Fatigue"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The threshold stimulus refers to the minimum intensity of a stimulus (like a nerve impulse) that is required to trigger an action potential in a muscle fiber and initiate a contractile response."

              - "Refractory period"
              - "Relaxation time"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The contraction time is the phase of a muscle twitch that spans from the onset of the electrical response (action potential) to the point of maximal tension development. This is when the sliding filament mechanism actively shortens the sarcomeres."
