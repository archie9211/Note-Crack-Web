description: "Test your understanding of excretory products, human excretory system, and kidney function with these multiple-choice questions."
mcqs:
      - text: "Hyperosmolarity of interstitial fluid in renal medulla is maintained by retaining high concentration of"
        options:
              - "Urea"
              - "TMAO"
              - "Urea and NaCl"
              - "Urea and Uric acid"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The interstitial fluid of the medulla region has a higher osmotic concentration, stated to be equal to 1200 mosm/lt, primarily due to higher quantities of two solutes: NaCl and urea. This concentration gradient is critical for the kidney's ability to concentrate urine."

      - text: "How much amount of blood passes through the kidneys per minute in a healthy person?"
        options:
              - "125-150 ml"
              - "600-700 ml"
              - "1100-1200 ml"
              - "180 litre"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Approximately 1100-1200 ml of blood is filtered by the two kidneys every minute. This constitutes roughly one-fifth (1/5th) of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a minute."

      - text: "Chemically glomerular filtrate is similar to blood plasma, except"
        options:
              - "Urea"
              - "Glucose"
              - "Proteins"
              - "Electrolytes"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Nephric filtrate, also known as glomerular filtrate, consists of various small-sized molecules like water, electrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc.), glucose, amino acids, hormones, vitamins, urea, creatinine, and uric acid. However, it specifically excludes large-sized particles and structures like fats, proteins, platelets, leucocytes, and erythrocytes. Therefore, it is similar to blood plasma, but without the proteins and blood cells."

      - text: "A fall in GFR can activate the JG cells to release, which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR back to normal"
        options:
              - "Renin"
              - "Angiotensin-II"
              - "Rennin"
              - "Erythropoietin"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA) located in the kidney responds to a decrease in blood pressure or blood volume in the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus. In response, it releases an enzyme called renin into the bloodstream. Renin then initiates a cascade of chemical reactions (Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, RAAS) that ultimately work to increase blood pressure and restore Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)."

      - text: "Substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+-etc. in the filtrate are reabsorbed by"
        options:
              - "Active transport"
              - "Passive transport"
              - "Both active and passive transport"
              - "Facilitated diffusion"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The absorption of useful essential substances from glomerular filtrate, such as glucose and amino acids, occurs through both active and passive processes. Active reabsorption, which includes secondary active transport for substances like glucose and amino acids, occurs against the concentration gradient and requires energy. Kidneys consume a significant amount of oxygen for these active processes, even more than the heart."

      - text: "Osmotic concentration of glomerular filtrate is the highest at the bottom of the U-shaped Henle's loop. It is about mOsmL–1"
        options:
              - "300"
              - "600"
              - "900"
              - "1200"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "As the filtrate moves down the descending limb of the Loop of Henle, from the cortex towards the inner medulla, its osmolarity progressively increases. This increase is due to water passing out of the filtrate into the hypertonic interstitial fluid of the medulla. At the bottom of the U-shaped Henle's loop, the osmolarity can reach up to approximately 1200 m osm L–1."

      - text: "Which part of nephron is impermeable to Hp but allows transport of electrolytes actively or passively?"
        options:
              - "PCT"
              - "Descending limb of Loop of Henle"
              - "Ascending limb of Loop of Henle"
              - "OCT"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The ascending limb of the Loop of Henle is distinctly impermeable to water (H₂O, or 'Hp' as assumed from context). However, its thin segment allows NaCl to diffuse out into the interstitial fluid, while its thick segment actively transports NaCl (and some Mg²+, Ca²+, K+) out of the filtrate, contributing to the high osmolarity of the inner medulla."

      - text: "Counter current mechanism helps in concentrating urine in animals and mainly operates on"
        options:
              - "a - Henle's loop"
              - "b -Vasa-recta"
              - "c - PCT"
              - "d - DCT"
        correct: [0, 1]
        explanation: "The Loop of Henle and the vasa recta (the network of capillaries surrounding the loop) both form a counter-current system. This special arrangement of blood flow and filtrate movement is significantly involved in maintaining a concentration gradient in the medullary interstitium, which in turn facilitates the reabsorption of water from the collecting duct, thereby concentrating the urine."

      - text: "Diuretic substances like tea, coffee, alcohol etc. increases urine output by inhibiting release of hormone _______________"
        options:
              - "Renin"
              - "Aldosterone"
              - "ADH"
              - "Erythropoietin"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The volume of urine produced is significantly influenced by the hormone Vasopressin, also known as ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone). In the presence of ADH, more water is reabsorbed, leading to concentrated urine; conversely, in its absence, dilute urine is passed out. Therefore, diuretic substances increase urine output by inhibiting the release of ADH, which reduces water reabsorption."

      - text: "Mark the inappropriate term w.r.t. the glomerular filtration"
        options:
              - "Non selective"
              - "Passive process"
              - "Active process"
              - "Occurs due to pressure difference"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Glomerular filtration, also called ultrafiltration, is a nonselective process, meaning it filters small molecules irrespective of whether they are useful or waste products. It is a passive process that occurs due to a net higher hydrostatic pressure (glomerular filtration pressure of approximately 10 mm Hg) in the glomerular capillaries compared to Bowman's capsule. Therefore, describing it as an 'active process' is inappropriate."

      - text: "Dialysis fluid contain all the constituents as in plasma, except ____"
        options:
              - "Glucose"
              - "NaCl"
              - "Amino acids"
              - "Urea"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "During haemodialysis, the patient's blood flows through a dialyzer filled with dialysis fluid. This dialysis fluid is specifically formulated to contain the same quantities of electrolytes and nutrients (like glucose, NaCl, amino acids) as normal blood plasma, but it critically contains no waste products. This difference in concentration gradient allows waste substances from the blood, such as urea, ammonia, and creatinine, to diffuse out of the blood and into the dialysis fluid."

      - text: "Reabsorption of Hp from distal parts of the tubules is facilitated by hormone ____"
        options:
              - "Vassopressin"
              - "ADH"
              - "Aldosterone"
              - "Both (1) & (2)"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Reabsorption of water (Hp, assumed to mean H₂O) from the distal parts of the nephron, specifically the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, is primarily controlled by the hormone Vasopressin, which is also known as ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone). In the presence of this hormone, the walls of these tubules become permeable to water, allowing its reabsorption and leading to more concentrated urine."

      - text: "Mark the incorrect statement"
        options:
              - "Micturition is carried out by a reflex"
              - "ADH helps in Hp elimination, making the urine hypotonic"
              - "Protein-free fluid is filtered from blood plasma into the Bowman's capsule"
              - "Glucose is actively reabsorbed in the PCT"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Let's analyze each statement:
              *   Micturition, the voiding of urine, is indeed carried out by an autonomic reflex.
              *   ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone) helps in water reabsorption, primarily in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, making the urine more concentrated (hypertonic), not hypotonic, to conserve body water. This statement is incorrect.
              *   During glomerular filtration, a protein-free fluid (glomerular filtrate) is indeed filtered from blood plasma into the Bowman's capsule.
              *   Glucose is completely reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate in the Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) through active transport.
              Therefore, the incorrect statement is that ADH helps in H₂O elimination (it helps in reabsorption) or makes urine hypotonic (it makes it hypertonic)."

      - text: "Which of the following organs, other than kidneys, also help in the elimination of excretory wastes?"
        options:
              - "a - Lungs"
              - "b - Liver"
              - "c - Skin"
              - "d - Sebaceous glands"
        correct: 3
        explanation:
              "Several organs in the human body, in addition to the kidneys, contribute to the elimination of excretory wastes:
              *   Lungs eliminate carbon dioxide (CO₂) and a significant amount of water vapor (around 400 ml/day in normal resting conditions).
              *   The skin, through sweat glands, excretes sweat, which contains water and some salts. Sebaceous glands in the skin eliminate sebum, containing waxes, sterols, hydrocarbons, and fatty acids.
              *   The liver produces bile pigments (bilirubin, biliverdin) from the breakdown of hemoglobin, and also eliminates cholesterol, inactivated steroid hormones, vitamins, and drugs.
              Therefore, all listed organs (lungs, liver, skin, and sebaceous glands) play a role in excretion."

      - text: "Find out the incorrectly matching pair w.r.t. the accessory excretory organs and the excretory wastes eliminated by them"
        options:
              - "Liver - Bilirubin, biliverdin and cholesterol"
              - "Lungs - CO₂ and Hp"
              - "Salivary gland - Heavy metals and drugs"
              - "Sudorific gland - Sebum containing waxes, sterols and fatty acids"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Let's evaluate each pair:
              *   Liver - Bilirubin, biliverdin and cholesterol: The liver produces bile pigments (bilirubin, biliverdin) as metabolic wastes of hemoglobin, and also eliminates cholesterol. This is a correct match.
              *   Lungs - CO₂ and Hp (water): The lungs help in removing CO₂ and water. This is a correct match.
              *   Salivary gland - Heavy metals and drugs: While salivary glands can excrete some substances, the provided source does not explicitly list them as major accessory excretory organs for heavy metals and drugs. This information is not directly in the source, but the general concept of other organs aiding excretion is.
              *   Sudorific gland - Sebum containing waxes, sterols and fatty acids: Sudorific glands are sweat glands, which excrete sweat (water and salts). Sebaceous glands are responsible for eliminating sebum (waxes, sterols, hydrocarbons, and fatty acids). Therefore, this pair is incorrectly matched."

      - text: "Presence of glucose (glycosuria) and ketone bodies (ketonuria) in urine are indicative of __"
        options:
              - "Renal failure"
              - "Diabetes mellitus"
              - "Bright's disease"
              - "Renal stone"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Glycosuria, the presence of glucose in urine, is a characteristic symptom of Diabetes mellitus. Ketonuria, the presence of ketone bodies in urine, is also a common finding in uncontrolled diabetes, as the body begins to break down fats for energy, producing ketones."

      - text: "In case of dehydration, secretion of all hormones increases except one, mark this except one"
        options:
              - "Renin"
              - "Aldosterone"
              - "Vassopressin"
              - "ANF"
        correct: 3
        explanation:
              "In a state of dehydration, the body's primary response is to conserve water and maintain blood volume. This triggers the release of:
              *   Renin (from JGA due to decreased blood pressure/volume).
              *   Angiotensin II (activated by renin), which stimulates the release of Aldosterone (from adrenal gland). Both promote Na+ and water reabsorption.
              *   Vasopressin (ADH) (from pituitary gland, triggered by increased blood osmolarity detected by osmoreceptors) to enhance water reabsorption.
              Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF), however, is released by the heart atria in response to *increased* blood volume and pressure. ANF acts to inhibit renin release and reduce aldosterone, thereby promoting Na+ and water excretion. Therefore, in dehydration (which involves decreased blood volume), the secretion of ANF would typically decrease, not increase."

      - text: "Which of the following is a powerful vasoconstrictor that increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby the GFR?"
        options:
              - "Renin"
              - "Angiotensin-II"
              - "Aldosterone"
              - "ANF"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Angiotensin II is described as a powerful constrictor of arterioles and one of the most potent vasopressor substances known. It increases blood pressure by causing efferent arterioles to constrict. This constriction downstream of the glomerulus raises the blood pressure within the glomerulus, thereby increasing the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)."

      - text: "Which part of brain sends voluntary motor signals to smooth muscles of urinary bladder when the bladder get filled with urine?"
        options:
              - "Medulla"
              - "Cerebral cortex"
              - "Hypothalamus"
              - "Brain stem"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Micturition (urination) is initially an autonomic reflex, triggered by stretch receptors in the urinary bladder as it fills. However, this process can be voluntarily controlled in adults. The cerebral cortex directs the external sphincter to relax, allowing a person to consciously initiate or inhibit urination. It enables voluntary control over the micturition reflex."

      - text: "Which of the following is not metabolised in human body and therefore, used in determining glomerular filtration rate?"
        options:
              - "Insulin"
              - "Inulin"
              - "Cellulose xanthate"
              - "Toxic ketones"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Inulin is a fructan storage polysaccharide that is not metabolized in the human body. It is readily filtered through the kidneys and neither reabsorbed nor secreted significantly by the renal tubules. Due to these properties, inulin is widely used as a standard substance for testing kidney function, particularly for accurately determining the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)."

      - text: "The animals which do not actively control the osmotic condition of their body fluids are"
        options:
              - "Osmoconformers"
              - "Osmoregulator"
              - "Hyperosmotic"
              - "Hypertonic"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Osmoconformers are organisms that allow their internal body fluid osmolarity to fluctuate and match that of their external environment, without expending significant energy to regulate it. In contrast, osmoregulators actively maintain a relatively constant internal osmotic condition."

      - text: "Which of the following can be termed as osmoconformers?"
        options:
              - "All marine invertebrates"
              - "Hagfish"
              - "All fresh water invertebrates"
              - "Both (1) & (2)"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Animals that do not actively control the osmotic condition of their body fluids are called osmoconformers. The sources indicate that Myxine (Hagfish) is an example of an animal that does not maintain a constant internal osmolarity different from the surrounding medium. Additionally, all marine invertebrates are generally known to be osmoconformers, allowing their body fluids to be isotonic with seawater."

      - text: "A fresh water fish maintains osmoregulation by"
        options:
              - "Continuously taking in water and eliminating excess of salts"
              - "Eliminating excess of water and taking up salts from the environment"
              - "Taking both water and salt from the environment"
              - "Eliminating both salt and water into the environment"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Freshwater fish live in a hypotonic environment, meaning water constantly tends to enter their bodies by osmosis, and salts tend to diffuse out. To counteract this, they maintain osmoregulation by eliminating excess water (producing large volumes of dilute urine) and actively taking up salts from their environment (e.g., through specialized cells in their gills). *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as this specific mechanism for freshwater fish is not detailed in the provided sources.*"

      - text: "Which of the following mean is used by fresh water organisms to prevent net gain of water or net loss of body salts?"
        options:
              - "Contractile vacuole"
              - "Large volume of dilute urine"
              - "Ionocytes"
              - "All of these"
        correct: 3
        explanation:
              "Freshwater organisms employ various strategies to manage water balance in their hypotonic environments. These include:
              *   Contractile vacuoles: Specialized organelles in many freshwater protozoans (like Amoeba) that actively expel excess water.
              *   Large volume of dilute urine: Kidneys of freshwater fish and amphibians produce copious amounts of very dilute urine to excrete excess water without losing too many vital salts.
              *   Ionocytes: Specialized cells (e.g., in fish gills) that actively absorb ions from the surrounding water to compensate for salt loss.
              Therefore, all of these mechanisms contribute to osmoregulation in freshwater organisms. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as these specific mechanisms are not detailed in the provided sources for freshwater organisms.*"

      - text: "Marine bony fish have body fluids hypotonic to sea water and tend to lose water from the body throug': a. Gill membrane b. Oral membrane c. Anal membrane"
        options:
              - "a only"
              - "a, b & c"
              - "a & c only"
              - "b & c only"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Marine bony fish live in a hypertonic environment, meaning water tends to leave their bodies by osmosis, and salts tend to enter. To counteract water loss, they drink seawater and actively excrete excess salts. Water loss occurs across all permeable body surfaces in contact with the water, including the gill membrane, oral membrane, and anal membrane. Therefore, water loss occurs through all three mentioned membranes. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as these specific membranes for water loss are not detailed in the provided sources for marine bony fish.*"

      - text: "Divalent cations are generally eliminated in marine fishes through"
        options:
              - "Gill membrane"
              - "Anal membrane"
              - "Faecal matter"
              - "Oral membrane"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Marine fish ingest seawater, which contains high concentrations of various ions, including divalent cations like magnesium (Mg²⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻). While gills are primarily involved in monovalent ion (Na⁺, Cl⁻) excretion, divalent cations are generally eliminated through the faecal matter as they are poorly absorbed in the intestine. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as the specific elimination route for divalent cations in marine fish is not detailed in the provided sources.*"

      - text: "Body fluids of shark and coeloacanths can be termed as"
        options:
              - "Hyperosmotic and hypoionic to sea water"
              - "Hypo-osmotic and hypoionic to sea water"
              - "Hyperosmotic and hyperionic to sea water"
              - "Hypo-osmotic and hyperionic to sea water"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, are unique in their osmoregulation. They retain a large amount of urea in their blood and tissue fluids as a major osmolyte. This high concentration of urea, along with trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), makes their body fluids have an overall solute concentration (osmolarity) higher than that of seawater, thus making them hyperosmotic. However, despite their high overall osmolarity, their concentration of specific inorganic ions (like Na+ and Cl-) is still lower than that of seawater, making them hypoionic in terms of salts. This adaptation helps them avoid net water loss to the marine environment."

      - text: "Consider the following water conservation mechanisms A. Nasal countercurrent mechanism B. Dependence on metabolic water C. Highly hypertonic urine D. Living more on protein rich diet The kangaroo rat living in desert can survive without drinking water because of"
        options:
              - "A, B & C"
              - "A, B & D"
              - "B, C & D"
              - "A, C & D"
        correct: 0
        explanation:
              "Kangaroo rats are desert-adapted mammals known for their remarkable water conservation abilities, allowing them to survive without drinking free water. Their key mechanisms include:
              *   Nasal countercurrent mechanism (A): Efficiently reclaims water vapor from exhaled air.
              *   Dependence on metabolic water (B): Generates a significant portion of their water needs from the metabolic oxidation of food (e.g., fats).
              *   Highly hypertonic urine (C): Their kidneys, particularly their very long Loops of Henle, produce extremely concentrated urine, minimizing water loss.
              *   Living on a protein-rich diet (D) would actually increase water requirements for the excretion of urea (a nitrogenous waste product of protein metabolism), making it counterproductive for water conservation.
              Therefore, the correct combination of mechanisms is A, B, and C. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as these specific mechanisms for kangaroo rats are not detailed in the provided sources.*"

      - text: "Select the true statement"
        options:
              - "In fishes kidney playa major role in ammonia excretion"
              - "Ammonia is 100,000 times less toxic than urea"
              - "Sharks retain a large amount of urea in the blood as a major osmolyte to balance the osmolarity of the body fluids"
              - "Most terrestrial reptile excrete ammonia"
        correct: 2
        explanation:
              "Let's analyze each statement based on the provided sources:
              *   Sharks retain a large amount of urea in the blood as a major osmolyte to balance the osmolarity of the body fluids: This statement is explicitly supported by the source, which mentions that cartilaginous fish (e.g., sharks) retain part of the urea produced in the kidney for osmoregulation.
              *   Ammonia is 100,000 times less toxic than urea: This is incorrect. The source states that ammonia is very toxic, and urea is comparatively less toxic, specifically 100,000 times less toxic than ammonia.
              *   Most terrestrial reptile excrete ammonia: This is incorrect. Terrestrial reptiles are primarily uricotelic, meaning they excrete uric acid, which helps in significant water conservation. Ammonia requires large amounts of water for excretion.
              *   In fishes kidney playa major role in ammonia excretion: This is incorrect. In fishes, ammonia (NH₄⁺) primarily diffuses out across gill epithelium, rather than being solely excreted by the kidneys."

              - "Alligators, Terrapins, Turtles"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Animals are classified based on their main excretory product. Ureotelic animals (excreting mainly urea) include cartilaginous fish, amphibians, and mammals. Specifically, the source states that in ureotelic animals, 'entire amount of urea produced is not excreted out but a part is retained in kidney and is involved in osmoregulation'. Examples of cartilaginous fish that retain urea for osmoregulation include sharks, and this would extend to other cartilaginous fish like electric rays and sting rays."

              - "Removal of amino group from an amino acid"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The source states that ammonia, the first metabolic waste product of protein metabolism, is produced in the liver by the process of deamination. Deamination is the biochemical process that involves the removal of an amino group (-NH₂) from an amino acid, converting it into ammonia and a keto acid."

              - "Nucleic acids"
              - "Starch"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The source mentions that uric acid is a component of urine and is derived from nucleic acid metabolism (purine). Purines are nitrogenous bases found in DNA and RNA, and their breakdown leads to uric acid."

              - "Urea"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Bird droppings, known as guano, consist of uric acid and phosphate-rich faeces. Birds are uricotelic, meaning they excrete uric acid. Uric acid is almost insoluble in water and can be passed out as a precipitate or in crystalline form. Urates are salts of uric acid, also found in crystalline form. Therefore, guano contains both insoluble crystals of uric acid and urates."

              - "Blood pressure constant"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Beyond waste elimination, the kidneys are crucial for osmoregulation, which involves maintaining the fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. This includes regulating blood volume, blood pressure, and plasma osmolarity. By adjusting reabsorption and secretion, kidneys ensure the constant composition of the blood and interstitial fluid, regardless of dietary intake, which is essential for homeostasis."

              - "Much convoluted uriniferous tubules and Malpighian corpuscles in this region"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The renal cortex is the outer functional layer of the kidney, described as dark in color and granular in nature. This granular appearance is due to the presence of numerous Malpighian corpuscles (which consist of the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule) and the highly twisted and coiled segments of the uriniferous tubules, specifically the Proximal Convoluted Tubules (PCT) and Distal Convoluted Tubules (DCT), which are predominantly located in the cortex."

        correct: 1
        explanation: "Towards the center of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called the hilum. This hilum serves as the entry and exit point for the ureter, blood vessels (renal artery and vein), and nerves. Inner to the hilum is a broad funnel-shaped space called the renal pelvis."

              - "Loop of Henle"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Podocytes are specialized cells found in the inner visceral layer of Bowman's capsule. These cells have numerous interdigitated evaginations called pedicels or feet, which rest over the basement membrane and enclose slit pores or filtration slits. These slits are crucial for the filtration of blood components into Bowman's capsule during urine formation."

              - "Bowman's capsule"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The nephron, also known as the uriniferous tubule, is explicitly identified as the structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons, and they are responsible for the entire process of urine formation."

      - text: "Henle's loops are found in those animals which excrete hypertonic urine. One of the following does not have Henle's loop"

              - "Frogs"
              - "None of these"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The presence and length of the Loop of Henle are crucial for the ability of a kidney to concentrate urine. Animals that produce highly concentrated (hypertonic) urine, such as mammals and birds (terrestrial vertebrates adapted for water conservation), possess well-developed Loops of Henle. However, amphibians like frogs, which typically excrete large volumes of dilute urine and can absorb water through their skin, generally lack a well-developed Loop of Henle, or have very short ones, limiting their ability to produce hypertonic urine."

              - "Pyramidal cells with characteristic brush border"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The Loop of Henle consists of a descending limb and an ascending limb. The thin segment of the descending limb, which lies in the medulla, is specifically lined by flat epithelial cells. These cells have sparse microvilli and few mitochondria, indicative of passive water movement."

              - "Columns of Bertin"
              - "Ureter"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "After receiving filtrate from nephrons, the collecting tubules open into still wider collecting ducts. As these collecting ducts descend into the medulla, they merge to form larger ducts known as the ducts of Bellini, which then run through the renal pyramids and ultimately lead to the renal papilla and calyces."

      - text: "Brush border surface can be taken as the characteristics feature of"

              - "Loop of Henle"
              - "DCT"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is lined by cuboidal epithelium that possesses prominent brush borders due to the presence of numerous long microvilli. These microvilli significantly increase the surface area for absorption by approximately 20 times, making the PCT highly efficient in reabsorbing essential substances from the filtrate."

              - "Cuboidal epithelium"
              - "Columnar epithelium"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The descending limb of the Loop of Henle has two parts: a thick segment and a thin segment. The thick segment constitutes about four-fifths of the descending limb and is lined by cuboidal cells. These cells have sparse microvilli and fewer mitochondria, indicating that active absorption and secretion are largely absent in this portion."

      - text: "Which of the following statement is not true w.r.t. nephron?"
        options:
              - "Cortical nephrons are more common"
              - "Cortical nephrons lack vasa recta"
              - "In juxtamedullary nephrons, the blood first passes through vasa recta and then through the capillaries of glomerulus"
              - "The glomeruli of juxtamedullary nephrons are placed close to the inner margin of the cortex"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Let's analyze the statements:
              *   Cortical nephrons are more common: Correct. They constitute about 85% of total nephrons.
              *   Cortical nephrons lack vasa recta: Correct. Vasa recta are absent or highly reduced in cortical nephrons.
              *   The glomeruli of juxtamedullary nephrons are placed close to the inner margin of the cortex: Correct. They are present at the junction of the cortex and medulla.
              *   In juxtamedullary nephrons, the blood first passes through vasa recta and then through the capillaries of glomerulus: This statement is not true. Blood always enters the kidney via the renal artery, which leads to afferent arterioles that form the glomerulus. After filtration in the glomerulus, blood exits via the efferent arteriole, which then forms the peritubular capillaries and the vasa recta around the Loop of Henle. Therefore, blood passes through the glomerulus *before* the vasa recta."

      - text: "Which of the following defines the net filtration pressure (NFP)?"
        options:
              - "BCOP – (GHP + CHP)"
              - "GHP – (BCOP + CHP)"
              - "(BCOP + GHP) – CHP"
              - "(GHP – CHP) + BCOP"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The glomerular filtration pressure (GFP), also known as the net filtration pressure (NFP), determines the rate of fluid movement from the glomerulus into Bowman's capsule. It is calculated by taking the glomerular hydrostatic pressure (GHP) and subtracting the sum of the opposing pressures: blood colloidal osmotic pressure (BCOP) and capsular hydrostatic pressure (CHP). The formula given in the source is GFP = GHP - (BCOP + CHP). For example, 60 mmHg (GHP) - (30 mmHg (BCOP) + 20 mmHg (CHP)) = 10 mmHg GFP."

      - text: "Which of the following is correct?"
        options:
              - "Afferent arteriole is narrower than the efferent arteriole"
              - "Efferent venule is narrower than vein"
              - "Efferent arteriole is narrower than afferent arteriole"
              - "Both afferent and efferent arteriole are of same diameter"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In the glomerulus, blood is supplied by the afferent arteriole and drained by the efferent arteriole. A key anatomical feature is that the efferent arteriole is narrower than the afferent arteriole. This difference in diameter creates resistance to blood outflow, which is crucial for maintaining a high blood pressure inside the glomerulus, driving the process of ultrafiltration."

      - text: "The glomerular filtration rate is"
        options:
              - "125 ml min–1"

              - "1300 ml min–1"
              - "Both (1) & (2)"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) represents the volume of filtrate formed by the kidneys per unit time. The source states that it produces a glomerular or nephric filtrate of about 125 ml/min. This rate translates to approximately 180 liters per day (125 ml/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day = 180,000 ml/day = 180 L/day). Therefore, both options (1) and (2) are correct representations of GFR."

      - text: "If the GFR is 125 ml min-1 and the renal plasma flow is 700 ml min-1, the filtration fraction is"
        options:
              - "About 6%"
              - "About 18%"
              - "About 12%"
              - "About 24%"
        correct: 1
        explanation:
              "The filtration fraction is the ratio of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to renal plasma flow (RPF), usually expressed as a percentage.
              Filtration Fraction = (GFR / Renal Plasma Flow) * 100%
              Given GFR = 125 ml/min and RPF = 700 ml/min:
              Filtration Fraction = (125 / 700) * 100% ≈ 0.1785 * 100% ≈ 18%.
              *The formula for filtration fraction is a standard physiological concept not explicitly detailed in the provided sources, but the calculation is based on the given values.*"

              - "Myogenic mechanism"
              - "Adam's stoke condition"
              - "Neurogenic mechanism"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The kidneys possess intrinsic autoregulatory mechanisms to maintain a relatively constant glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite fluctuations in systemic blood pressure. The myogenic mechanism is a primary intrinsic autoregulatory response of the afferent arteriole to changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure increases, the smooth muscle in the afferent arteriole stretches and contracts, leading to vasoconstriction and reducing blood flow to the glomerulus, thereby maintaining a stable GFR. Conversely, a drop in pressure leads to vasodilation. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as this specific mechanism is not detailed in the provided sources.*"

              - "Descending limb of Henle's loop"
              - "Ascending limb of Henle's loop"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The ascending limb of the Loop of Henle is a crucial segment for creating the osmotic gradient in the medulla. Unlike the descending limb which is permeable to water, the ascending limb is specifically impermeable to water. Instead, it actively or passively transports solutes, primarily NaCl, out of the filtrate, contributing to the increasing osmolarity of the medullary interstitium."

              - "Ascending limb of Henle's loop"
              - "All of these"
        correct: 3
        explanation:
              "Active reabsorption of ions like Na+ and K+ occurs in multiple segments of the nephron:
              *   Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): Actively reabsorbs Na+ and K+.
              *   Ascending limb of Henle's loop: The thick segment actively transports NaCl out, and also some K+.
              *   Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Na+ is actively reabsorbed under the influence of hormones like aldosterone.
              Therefore, active reabsorption of these ions takes place in all of these listed parts of the nephron."

              - "H+ ions and urea"
              - "Ammonia and creatinine"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Tubular secretion involves the active transfer of waste products from the peritubular capillaries into the nephric filtrate in the PCT and DCT. While the provided source generally mentions waste products are secreted, in the context of acid-base balance, the kidneys secrete substances like hydrogen ions (H+) and ammonia into the filtrate to regulate blood pH. This helps to eliminate excess acid from the body. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as the specific link between H+ and ammonia secretion and acid-base balance is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources.*"

              - "In the interstitial fluid"
              - "In the middle of Henle's loop"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The osmolarity of the filtrate changes significantly as it passes through the nephron. As the filtrate moves up the ascending limb of the Loop of Henle, NaCl is actively transported out, making the filtrate progressively more dilute. By the time the filtrate reaches the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and then the collecting ducts in the cortical region, its concentration of solutes, including Na+ and Cl–, becomes hypotonic to blood plasma, hence lowest near the cortex."

        options:
              - "The counter current mechanism changes the isotonic glomerular filtrate into a hypertonic urine by increasing salt concentration around the nephron and collecting tubule"
              - "The wall of collecting tubule is permeable to water whereas ascending limb is impermeable to water"
              - "The absorption of water in DCT is facultative"
              - "As the filtrate passes through the ascending limb, sodium is transported passively in ascending thick segment"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Let's evaluate each statement:
              *   The counter-current mechanism, involving the Loop of Henle and vasa recta, does create a concentration gradient (due to NaCl and urea) in the medullary interstitium, which helps in concentrating the filtrate (urine) from an initial isotonic state to a hypertonic one. (Correct)
              *   The collecting ducts' walls become permeable to water in the presence of ADH, allowing water reabsorption. The ascending limb of Henle's loop is indeed impermeable to water. (Correct)
              *   Water reabsorption in the DCT is facultative, meaning it is regulated and dependent on the presence of ADH (vasopressin). (Correct)
              *   The thick segment of the ascending limb of Henle's loop actively transports NaCl into the outer interstitial fluid. Therefore, stating that sodium is transported passively in the ascending thick segment is wrong."

              - "Uricase"
              - "Arginase"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA), a specialized structure within the kidney, releases the enzyme renin into the bloodstream. Renin is a key component of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance."

              - "All of these"
        correct: 3
        explanation:
              "Angiotensin II is a powerful hormone that significantly contributes to increasing blood volume and pressure. The sources explicitly state that it works in two ways:
              1.  By signalling the proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) to reabsorb more NaCl and water.
              2.  By stimulating the adrenal gland to release aldosterone, which further induces the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) to reabsorb more Na+ and water.
              Additionally, Angiotensin II is also known to stimulate the release of ADH (vasopressin), which directly increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts, further contributing to blood volume increase. Therefore, all of these mechanisms contribute to the increase in blood volume by Angiotensin II. *The direct stimulation of ADH release by Angiotensin II is common physiological knowledge, even though this specific source emphasizes the PCT and aldosterone pathways.*"

              - "Renin"
              - "Rennin"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The reabsorption of sodium ions (Na+) in the distal parts of the nephron, particularly the distal convoluted tubule, is primarily controlled by the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone, released from the adrenal gland, induces the reabsorption of more Na+ and water, thereby increasing blood volume and pressure."

              - "Has nothing to do with permeability of convoluted tubule"
              - "Decreases permeability of proximal convoluted tubule"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "When the osmolarity of the blood increases (e.g., due to decreased body fluid volume or dehydration), osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus trigger the release of ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone) from the pituitary gland. ADH then acts on the kidneys to enhance fluid retention. It does this by increasing the permeability of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubules/ducts to water, allowing more water to be reabsorbed back into the blood from the filtrate."

              - "LH"
              - "ADH"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The reabsorption of water in the distal parts of the kidney tubules, specifically the collecting tubules and collecting ducts, is directly regulated by the hormone Vasopressin or ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone). In the presence of ADH, these tubule walls become permeable to water, allowing its reabsorption and leading to the formation of concentrated urine."

              - "Urochrome"
              - "Melanin"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Normal urine is transparent and pale yellow in color. This characteristic color is primarily due to the presence of a pigment called urochrome, which is a breakdown product of hemoglobin."

        correct: 3
        explanation: "Vitamins are broadly categorized into fat-soluble (A, D, E, K) and water-soluble (B vitamins, C). Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body and not readily excreted. Water-soluble vitamins, such as Vitamin C, are not stored in large quantities and any excess intake beyond the body's immediate needs is readily excreted in the urine. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as the specific excretion of Vitamin C is not detailed in the provided sources.*"

              - "The increase in concentration of blood urea"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Haematuria is a medical disorder explicitly defined in the sources as the presence of blood in the urine. This indicates an abnormality in the urinary tract or kidneys, as blood cells (like erythrocytes) are normally excluded from the glomerular filtrate."

              - "Kidney uncovered by Peritoneum on Dorsal Side."
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The arrangement of the human kidneys is described as Retroperitoneal. This means that the kidneys are fused with the body wall on the dorsal side, and the peritoneal cover (a membrane lining the abdominal cavity) is present only on the ventral side. Therefore, the kidney is uncovered by peritoneum on the dorsal side."

              - "First is white whereas later is yellow"
              - "First is yellow whereas later is white"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Glomerular filtrate is formed by the filtration of blood from the glomerulus into Bowman's capsule. This filtrate is chemically similar to blood plasma in terms of small solutes like electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, and urea. However, the key difference is that the filtration barrier in the glomerulus prevents the passage of large molecules and cellular components. Therefore, glomerular filtrate essentially consists of plasma minus large proteins and blood cells."

              - "Anuria"
              - "Ketonuria"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Anuria is the medical term for the failure of the kidneys to produce or excrete urine. While not explicitly defined in the disorders list of the provided sources, it contrasts with conditions like polyuria (excessive urine output), haematuria (blood in urine), and glycosuria (glucose in urine). *The term 'Anuria' itself is inferred as a medical term from the context of kidney disorders listed in the source, though its definition is not directly provided.*"

              - "The water balance of the body is disturbed"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The source mentions that 'Diuretic substances like tea, coffee, alcohol etc. increases urine output'. Therefore, diuresis is a condition characterized by an increase in the excretory volume of urine."

              - "Ketonuria"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine is medically termed Haematuria. Normally, RBCs are too large to pass through the glomerular filtration barrier, so their presence indicates a problem within the kidney or urinary tract."

              - "Digestion"
              - "Nutrition"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The ornithine cycle (also known as the urea cycle) is a metabolic pathway that occurs primarily in the liver. Its main function is to convert highly toxic ammonia (produced from protein metabolism) into less toxic urea, which can then be safely transported in the blood to the kidneys for elimination. Therefore, the ornithine cycle is fundamentally related to excretion of nitrogenous wastes."

              - "ADH"
        correct: 1
        explanation:
              "The volume and concentration of urine are tightly regulated by hormonal control. The key hormones involved are:
              *   ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): Controls the permeability of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts to water, directly influencing water reabsorption and urine concentration.
              *   Aldosterone: Stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions (Na+) in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, and water follows passively.
              Both hormones work in concert to adjust the final volume and osmolarity of urine based on the body's hydration status."

              - "Proximal convoluted tubule"
              - "Distal convoluted tubule"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is the primary and major site of reabsorption in the nephron. It is highly specialized for this function, with its epithelial cells having abundant microvilli (brush border) to increase absorptive area. The source explicitly states that the whole of glucose is reabsorbed in the PCT."

      - text: "Patients of diabeties have glucose in urine because"
        options:
              - "Glucose is not absorbed from G.F."
              - "Glucose is absorbed from G.F."
              - "Glandular cells secreted glucose in G.F."
              - "Concentration of glucose is more in G.F. as compared to its normal amount"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The presence of glucose in urine, known as glycosuria, is a characteristic of Diabetes mellitus. While the PCT normally reabsorbs all glucose from the glomerular filtrate, in diabetes, blood glucose levels become abnormally high. This means the concentration of glucose in the glomerular filtrate is much higher than its normal amount, exceeding the 'tubular maxima' (the maximum transport capacity) for glucose reabsorption. When the transport proteins in the PCT become saturated, the excess glucose cannot be reabsorbed and is thus excreted in the urine."

              - "Both (1) and (2)"
              - "Descending limb of Henle's loop"
        correct: 2
        explanation:
              "Both sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl–) ions are extensively removed (reabsorbed) from the glomerular filtrate in multiple parts of the nephron:
              *   Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): More than 70% of Na+ and a good quantity of Cl– are reabsorbed here.
              *   Ascending limb of Henle's loop: The thin segment loses NaCl to the interstitial fluid through diffusion, and the thick segment actively transports NaCl out.
              Therefore, both the Proximal Convoluted Tubule and the Ascending limb of Henle's loop are involved in the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl–."

              - "Substance of no further use or those present in excessive quantities are thrown out of the body"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Excretion is broadly defined as the process of removal of metabolic wastes from the body. This encompasses the elimination of substances that are no longer useful or are present in excessive, potentially harmful quantities, ensuring the maintenance of internal homeostasis."

      - text: "Which of the following sets of animals produce the same substance as their chief excretory product"

              - "Frog, monkey and dog"
        correct: 3
        explanation:
              "Animals are classified as ammonotelic, ureotelic, or uricotelic based on their primary nitrogenous waste product.
              *   Ammonotelic (Ammonia): Aquatic invertebrates (e.g., Amoeba), bony fish, tadpole larva of frog.
              *   Ureotelic (Urea): Cartilaginous fish, amphibians (adult frog), mammals (e.g., camel, antelope, monkey, dog).
              *   Uricotelic (Uric acid): Reptiles (e.g., snake), birds (e.g., pigeon), cockroach (insect).
              Considering the options:

              - "Maintaining a high osmotic pressure in the tissues between the tubules"
              - "High oxidative metabolism of medullary cells"
              - "Rapid flow of blood through the medulla"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The ability of the mammalian kidney to produce concentrated urine is largely attributed to the counter-current mechanism involving the Loop of Henle and vasa recta. This mechanism works to maintain a high osmotic concentration gradient in the interstitial fluid of the renal medulla. This hyperosmolarity, created primarily by the accumulation of NaCl and urea, provides the osmotic pull for water to be reabsorbed from the collecting ducts, thereby concentrating the urine."

              - "Bowman’s capsule"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The nephron, also called the uriniferous tubule, is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. It is composed of several distinct parts, including the Glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT), Loop of Henle, and Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT). Therefore, the Loop of Henle is an integral part of the uriniferous tubule."

              - "Secretion, absorption and filtration"
        correct: 1
        explanation:
              "Urine formation in the kidney is a complex process that occurs in three main steps, in a specific sequence:
              1.  Glomerular Filtration (Ultrafiltration): Blood is filtered in the glomerulus, producing a protein-free fluid called glomerular filtrate.
              2.  Tubular Reabsorption: Useful substances (like glucose, amino acids, most water and electrolytes) are selectively reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood.
              3.  Tubular Secretion: Waste products and excess ions that were not filtered are actively secreted from the blood into the filtrate.
              This sequential process ensures the efficient removal of wastes while conserving essential body components."

              - "Secretion of nitrogenous waste"
              - "Renal filtration"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Blood flow through the glomerular capillaries occurs under significant pressure, known as glomerular hydrostatic pressure (GHP). This pressure is the primary driving force for glomerular filtration. A severe fall in systemic blood pressure directly translates to a decrease in GHP, which would then reduce the net filtration pressure (GFP) and consequently, the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)."

      - text: "In a glomerulus –"
        options:
              - "Afferent capillaries are thicker than efferent capillaries"
              - "Afferent arteriole is thicker than efferent arteriole"
              - "Afferent arteriole is thinner than efferent arteriole"
              - "Afferent capillaries are thinner than efferent capillaries"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries supplied by an afferent arteriole and drained by an efferent arteriole. A crucial anatomical feature is that the afferent arteriole (which brings blood to the glomerulus) has a wider diameter than the efferent arteriole (which carries blood away). This difference in lumen diameter helps to maintain the high blood pressure necessary for efficient ultrafiltration within the glomerulus."

      - text: "High blood pressure is maintained in glomeruli than in other capillaries because –"
        options:
              - "The variability of the diameters of arterioles causes higher resistance to blood flowing out of the glomeruli than to out of the capillaries"
              - "Glomeruli has low hydrostatic pressure than capillary"
              - "Capillary has less diameter than glomeruli"
              - "All the above"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "High blood pressure is essential within the glomerulus for effective ultrafiltration. This high pressure is maintained primarily because the efferent arteriole, which drains blood from the glomerulus, has a narrower diameter than the afferent arteriole that supplies blood to it. This creates a higher resistance to blood flow out of the glomerulus, leading to increased hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries, facilitating filtration."

      - text: "Ultrafilatration occurs in a glomerulus when-"
        options:
              - "Osmotic pressure exceeds hydrostatic pressure"
              - "Hydrostatic pressure exceeds osmotic pressure"
              - "Colloidal osmotic pressure plus capsular pressure remain less than glomerular hydrostatic pressure"
              - "Capsular hydrostatic pressure exceeds glomerular hydrostatic pressure"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Ultrafiltration in the glomerulus occurs when the net filtration pressure is positive. This net pressure is calculated as Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure (GHP) minus the sum of Blood Colloidal Osmotic Pressure (BCOP) and Capsular Hydrostatic Pressure (CHP). For filtration to proceed, the driving force (GHP) must be greater than the sum of the opposing forces (BCOP + CHP). Therefore, ultrafiltration occurs when colloidal osmotic pressure plus capsular pressure remain less than glomerular hydrostatic pressure."

        options:
              - "Water is lost due to defecation"
              - "Water is lost due to evaporation"
              - "Water is lost along with salts in the form of sweat"
              - "Water is lost in the form of urine"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Deep mine environments are often hot and humid, leading to significant physiological stress. Workers in such conditions would experience extensive sweating as a thermoregulatory response. The skin contains numerous sweat glands that excrete sweat, which is composed of a large amount of water and some metabolic wastes including salts. This continuous and substantial loss of water and electrolytes through sweating leads to dehydration if not adequately replenished. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge regarding sweating and dehydration, which is consistent with the source's description of skin as an excretory organ.*"

      - text: "Aquatic animals are mostly ammonotelic because –"
        options:
              - "Excretion of ammonia requires large amount of water which is available to these animals"
              - "Ammonia helps in checking inflow of water into body"
              - "These get less light"
              - "Water contains less nitrogen"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Ammonotelism is a mode of excretion where the main excretory product is ammonia. Ammonia is highly toxic and necessitates a large amount of water for its excretion to dilute it to safe levels. Aquatic animals, living in an environment with an abundant supply of water, can readily excrete ammonia by diffusing it out across their body surface or gill epithelium, making this an energetically efficient excretory strategy for them."

              - "K+ ions"
              - "Na+ ions"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Aldosterone is a hormone released by the adrenal gland that plays a crucial role in regulating electrolyte balance and blood volume. Its primary action in the kidney is to induce the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) to reabsorb more sodium ions (Na+) and, consequently, water. This reabsorption helps to increase blood volume and pressure."

              - "Constriction of the efferent arteriole"
        correct: 1
        explanation:
              "The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is directly influenced by the net filtration pressure.
              *   An increase in renal blood flow or afferent arteriolar pressure would increase GHP, thus increasing GFR.
              *   Constriction of the efferent arteriole would increase the pressure within the glomerulus (GHP), also increasing GFR.
              *   Compression of the renal capsule would increase the capsular hydrostatic pressure (CHP), which is an opposing force to filtration. An increase in CHP would reduce the net filtration pressure, thereby decreasing the GFR."

              - "Loop of Henle"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The fluid in Bowman's capsule is initially a glomerular filtrate, which then passes through the PCT, Loop of Henle, and DCT, undergoing significant modifications (reabsorption and secretion). By the time the filtrate reaches the collecting tubules and collecting ducts, its composition has been fine-tuned and it is considered final urine. Therefore, the term 'urine' can first be appropriately applied to the fluid within the collecting tubule."

        correct: 2
        explanation: "The unpleasant or ammonical smell often associated with urine on standing is explicitly stated in the source to be due to the conversion of urea into ammonia by microbial action. Bacteria present in the environment or residual in the urinal break down urea, releasing volatile ammonia gas."

      - text: "A person who is starving, that is not having food, water and beverages will have –"
        options:
              - "Less urea in his urine"
              - "Less fats in his urine"
              - "More glucose in his blood"
              - "More urea in his blood"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "During prolonged starvation without food intake, the body initially utilizes stored carbohydrates, then fats, and eventually begins to break down proteins for energy. While protein breakdown produces ammonia (which is converted to urea), a person in a long hunger strike with only water intake would primarily focus on conserving water. This involves maximizing water reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to a highly concentrated but reduced volume of urine. Over a long period, if protein catabolism slows down or if the body goes into a state of protein conservation, the overall production and excretion of urea might decrease, leading to less urea in his urine (in terms of total output, not necessarily concentration per unit volume). *This explanation involves inferences and general physiological knowledge beyond the direct statements in the sources regarding starvation and urine composition.*"

      - text: "What is “renal threshold” –"
        options:
              - "The highest concentration of substances upto which it is totally reabsorbed from glomerular filtrate"
              - "At which all the substances are reabsorbed"
              - "At which the filtration of a substance starts"
              - "At which no substance is filtered in the glomerulus"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The concept of 'tubular maxima' is closely related to renal threshold. The source defines 'tubular maxima' as the maximum amount of substance that can be retained in blood (meaning maximally reabsorbed by the tubules) and beyond which it will be excreted in urine. Therefore, the renal threshold represents the highest concentration of a substance in the blood (and thus in the filtrate) up to which it can be completely reabsorbed by the renal tubules, preventing its appearance in the urine."

      - text: "The glomerular filtrate contains –"
        options:
              - "Blood minus cells"
              - "Blood minus cell and proteins"
              - "Plasma minus cells and proteins"
              - "Blood minus proteins"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The process of ultrafiltration in the glomerulus separates small molecules from larger ones. The resulting nephric (glomerular) filtrate consists of water, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, hormones, vitamins, urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Crucially, it excludes large-sized particles and structures like fats, proteins, platelets, leucocytes, and erythrocytes (blood cells). Therefore, the glomerular filtrate is essentially blood without its cells and proteins."

              - "Anuria"
              - "Ketosis"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Dysuria is the medical term used to describe painful or difficult urination. *This term and its definition are not explicitly provided in the disorders list within the given sources, thus this explanation relies on general medical knowledge.*"

              - "Salt"
              - "Insulin"
              - "Glucose"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "In diabetes mellitus, there is a characteristic condition called glycosuria, which means the presence of glucose in the urine. Due to high blood glucose levels exceeding the renal threshold, glucose remains in the filtrate. This excess glucose acts as an osmotic diuretic, drawing more water into the renal tubules and preventing its reabsorption. This leads to increased urine volume (polyuria), which in turn causes dehydration and increased thirst, prompting the patient to drink more water."

      - text: "A patient who excretes large quantity of sodium in urine has –"
        options:
              - "Diseased adrenal cortex"

              - "Diseased parathyroid"
              - "Diseased thymus"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The reabsorption of sodium ions (Na+) in the distal tubules and collecting ducts is primarily regulated by the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone is produced and released by the adrenal cortex. If the adrenal cortex is diseased and its function is impaired (e.g., leading to insufficient aldosterone production), less sodium would be reabsorbed by the kidneys, resulting in the excretion of a large quantity of sodium in the urine."

              - "A salt such as oxalate crystallised in pelvis"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "A kidney stone, medically termed Renal Calculi, is defined as an insoluble mass of crystallized salts formed within the kidney. These stones are often composed of substances like calcium oxalate, uric acid, or calcium phosphate, and they typically form in the broad funnel-shaped space of the renal pelvis."

              - "None of these"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Glycosuria is a medical term explicitly defined as the presence of glucose in urine. This indicates that glucose, which is normally completely reabsorbed in the PCT, is being lost from the body via the urine."

      - text: "Part not belonging to uriniferous tubule is –"
        options:

              - "Distal convoluted tuble"
              - "Collecting duct"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "A nephron, also known as a uriniferous tubule, is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each nephron consists of the glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT), Loop of Henle, and Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT). The collecting duct receives filtrate from multiple nephrons and is generally considered part of the collecting system, not an integral part of a single uriniferous tubule itself."

              - "Sebum = sexual attraction"
              - "Humerus = Hind leg"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The skin contains numerous sweat glands that excrete sweat. While the source highlights sweat as an excretory product, a primary physiological function of sweating is temperature regulation through evaporative cooling. *This specific link between sweat and temperature regulation, while a fundamental biological concept, is not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but consistent with the role of skin as an accessory excretory organ.*"

              - "Germinal cells"
              - "None of them"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The Malpighian body (or renal corpuscle) is the complex formed by the glomerulus, connective tissue, and Bowman's capsule. The renal cortex is the outer part of the kidney, and it is in this region that the glomeruli of cortical nephrons (which make up about 85% of all nephrons) are located. Additionally, the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, which are continuous with the Malpighian corpuscle, also primarily reside in the cortex."

              - "Pronephric"
              - "Opisthonephric"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The source refers to the metanephric kidneys as the most advanced type, characterized by the presence of the Loop of Henle, and states that these kidneys are found in mammals. Both rabbits and humans are mammals, thus possessing metanephric kidneys."

              - "All the above"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The epithelial lining of the Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is characterized by the presence of brush borders. These brush borders are formed by numerous long microvilli that significantly increase the surface area available for reabsorption, making the PCT highly efficient in recovering essential substances from the glomerular filtrate."

              - "Urea in both tadpole & adult frog"
              - "Urea in tadpole and uric acid in adult frog"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The mode of nitrogenous waste excretion varies with developmental stage in amphibians. The tadpole larva of a frog is aquatic and is classified as ammonotelic, primarily excreting ammonia. The adult frog, being an amphibian, is ureotelic, mainly excreting urea. This shift reflects their adaptation from an aquatic to a more terrestrial lifestyle, as urea requires less water for excretion than ammonia."

      - text: "Reabsorption of useful substances from glomerular filtrate occurs in"

              - "Proximal convoluted tuble"
              - "Distal convoluted tuble"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "While reabsorption occurs in all parts of the uriniferous tubule (PCT, Loop of Henle, DCT, collecting tubule), the Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is explicitly identified as the major site of reabsorption. It reabsorbs more than two-thirds of the glomerular filtrate volume, including essential nutrients like all glucose and amino acids, along with a significant amount of electrolytes and water."

              - "Distal convoluted tuble (distal part)"
              - "All the above"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone) plays a crucial role in regulating the final concentration of urine by controlling water reabsorption in the latter parts of the nephron. Specifically, it influences the water permeability of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and the collecting tubules/ducts. In the presence of ADH, the walls of these segments become permeable to water, allowing its reabsorption back into the bloodstream."

      - text: "What will happen if one kidney is removed from the body of a human being"

              - "Stoppage of urination"
              - "Nothing, the person will survive and remain normal kidney will become hypertrophied"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Humans are born with two kidneys, but a single healthy kidney is generally sufficient to maintain normal kidney function and overall health. If one kidney is removed (nephrectomy), the remaining kidney can undergo compensatory hypertrophy, meaning it enlarges and increases its functional capacity to compensate for the loss of the other kidney. Therefore, a person can survive and remain normal with one kidney. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as this specific scenario is not detailed in the provided sources.*"

      - text: "Total filtrate formed in 24 hours in human kidney is –"

              - "18 litres"
              - "180 litres"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a healthy human produces approximately 125 ml of filtrate per minute. When extrapolated over 24 hours, this equates to a total of about 180 liters per day (125 ml/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day = 180,000 ml/day)."

              - "Liver"
              - "Brain"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Ammonia is a highly toxic metabolic waste product, primarily resulting from protein deamination. To reduce its toxicity for transport and excretion, ammonia is converted into less toxic urea. This crucial conversion process, known as the urea cycle (ornithine cycle), takes place predominantly in the liver."

      - text: "Which vitamin is excreted out in high quantity through urine in man–"
        options:

              - "Vit. E"
              - "Vit. K"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Vitamins are classified as either fat-soluble (Vitamins A, D, E, K) or water-soluble (B vitamins and Vitamin C). Fat-soluble vitamins tend to be stored in the body, whereas water-soluble vitamins are generally not stored and are readily excreted if consumed in excess. Therefore, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is excreted in high quantities through urine in humans when intake exceeds the body's immediate needs. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as the specific excretion of Vitamin C is not detailed in the provided sources.*"

      - text: "If the afferent arteriole diameter is less than efferent arteriole than what happen"
        options:
              - "No effect"

              - "Ultrafiltration is not possilbe."
              - "Ultrafiltration will stop & tubular secretion is start"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Normally, the afferent arteriole is wider than the efferent arteriole. This difference in diameter creates resistance to blood outflow, which maintains high pressure within the glomerulus, essential for ultrafiltration. If the afferent arteriole's diameter were *less* than the efferent arteriole's, it would significantly reduce blood flow into the glomerulus and lead to a drastic drop in glomerular hydrostatic pressure. Without sufficient pressure, the net filtration pressure would likely become zero or negative, rendering ultrafiltration impossible or extremely inefficient."

      - text: "Concentration of urine depends upon which organ–"
        options:
              - "Bowman's capsule"

              - "P.C.T."
              - "Network of capillaries arising from glomerulus"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The ability of the kidney to produce concentrated urine is directly related to the Loop of Henle. The longer the Loop of Henle, especially in juxtamedullary nephrons, the greater the osmotic gradient it can establish in the renal medulla, which allows for more water reabsorption from the collecting ducts and thus more concentrated urine. The source explicitly states, 'The capability of concentrating the urine is largely related to the length of loop of Henle'."

      - text: "Conversion of ammonia to urea is done by ........."
        options:
              - "Ornithine cycle"

              - "Fumaric cycle"
              - "Citrulline cycle"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The process by which ammonia (NH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) are converted into urea for excretion occurs in the liver. This metabolic pathway is formally known as the urea cycle, but it is also commonly referred to as the ornithine cycle, after one of the key amino acids involved in the pathway."

      - text: "The movement of Ions against the concentration gradient will be–"
        options:
              - "Active transport"
              - "Osmosis"
              - "Diffusion"
              - "All"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The movement of ions or other substances from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, or against their concentration gradient, requires energy. This process is known as active transport. In the kidneys, active reabsorption of many useful substances (e.g., Na+, K+) occurs against their concentration gradient, consuming significant energy. In contrast, osmosis and diffusion are passive processes that occur along the concentration gradient and do not require direct energy input."

      - text: "If henle's loop were absent from mammalian nephron, which of the following is to be expected–"
        options:
              - "There will be no urine formation"
              - "There wil be hardly any change in the quality and quntity of urine formed"
              - "The urine will be more concentrated"
              - "The urine will be more dilute"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The Loop of Henle plays a crucial role in establishing and maintaining the osmotic gradient in the renal medulla, which is essential for the kidney's ability to produce concentrated urine. If the Loop of Henle were absent from mammalian nephrons, this concentrating mechanism would be severely impaired. As a result, the kidney would lose its ability to reabsorb significant amounts of water efficiently, leading to the formation of a much more dilute urine and a considerable loss of body water."

              - "Nephridia, malpighi tubules, kidney"
              - "Nephridia, kidney, green gland"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The main excretory structures for these animals are:
              *   Cockroach: As an insect (Arthropod), its main excretory structures are Malpighian tubules.
              *   Earthworm: As an annelid, its main excretory structures are Nephridia.
              *   Rabbit: As a mammal (Vertebrate), its main excretory structures are a pair of kidneys.
              Therefore, the correct order is Malpighian tubules, Nephridia, Kidney."

              - "75 mm Hg"
              - "30 mm Hg"
        correct: 0
        explanation:
              "The net pressure gradient responsible for filtration, known as the glomerular filtration pressure (GFP), is calculated as: GFP = Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure (GHP) - (Blood Colloidal Osmotic Pressure (BCOP) + Capsular Hydrostatic Pressure (CHP)).
              According to the source, GHP = 60 mm Hg, BCOP = 30 mm Hg, and CHP = 20 mm Hg.
              Thus, GFP = 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 mm Hg.
              *Note: While the source calculates the net filtration pressure as 10 mm Hg, the provided answer key indicates 20 mm Hg. This discrepancy cannot be resolved based solely on the provided source material.* For the purpose of this YAML, the correct index (0 for 20 mmHg) is used as per the provided answer key, but the calculation from the source yields 10 mmHg."

      - text: "Which one of the following blood vessel in mammals contains least amount of urea–"
        options:

              - "Dorsal aorta"
              - "Renal vein"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Urea is produced in the liver and transported in the blood. The kidneys are responsible for filtering urea from the blood. Blood enters the kidneys via the renal artery and exits via the renal vein. After the blood has been filtered in the glomerulus and urea has been removed via urine formation, the renal vein carries the blood with the least amount of urea away from the kidneys and back to systemic circulation. In contrast, the hepatic vein carries blood away from the liver (where urea is produced), and the hepatic portal vein carries nutrient-rich blood to the liver (which then processes and produces urea)."

        options:
              - "Less urea in his urine"
              - "More sodium in his urine"
              - "Less amino acids in his urine"
              - "More glucose in his blood"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "During a prolonged hunger strike with only water intake, the body primarily utilizes stored fats and then proteins for energy. While protein catabolism typically produces urea, long-term starvation aims to conserve body protein. Additionally, without food intake, the body would be in a water conservation state (if fluids are limited), leading to more concentrated urine and potentially a reduction in the total amount of solutes, including urea, excreted to conserve water. Therefore, one would expect less urea in his urine (in terms of total daily excretion, even if highly concentrated). *This explanation draws on general physiological knowledge as the specific effects of prolonged starvation on urine urea content are not detailed in the provided sources.*"

              - "ADH"
              - "MSH"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The reabsorption of water in the distal segments of the nephron, particularly the distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubules and ducts, is largely controlled by the hormone ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone), also known as Vasopressin. In the presence of ADH, the walls of these tubules become permeable to water, facilitating its reabsorption back into the bloodstream."

              - "Incrase in blood urea level"
              - "Loss of glucose through urine"
        correct: 3
        explanation:
              "Insufficient filtration in Bowman's capsule implies a reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). This would lead to:
              *   Accumulation of fluid in the body as less fluid is filtered and excreted.
              *   Increase in blood pressure due to the increased fluid volume in circulation.
              *   Increase in blood urea level (Uremia) as metabolic waste products like urea are not adequately removed from the blood.
              *   Loss of glucose through urine (Glycosuria): This is unlikely to happen due to insufficient filtration. Glucose is normally completely reabsorbed in the PCT. If filtration is insufficient, less glucose would even reach the tubules, and therefore less would be present in urine. Glycosuria primarily occurs when blood glucose levels are too high, exceeding the tubules' reabsorption capacity (as in diabetes mellitus). Therefore, 'Loss of glucose through urine' is the exception."

              - "Damage to the Malpighian corpuscles"
              - "Damage to the proximal convoluted tubules"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Albumin is a large protein that is normally excluded from the glomerular filtrate during filtration. The Malpighian corpuscle (which includes the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule) is the site of ultrafiltration, acting as the filtration barrier. If there is damage to the Malpighian corpuscles, particularly the filtration barrier within the glomerulus (composed of endothelial fenestrations, basement membrane, and podocytes), proteins like albumin can leak through and appear in the urine (a condition known as proteinuria)."

              - "Adrenal cortex"
              - "Adrenal medulla"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Urinary excretion and reabsorption of sodium ions (Na+) are primarily regulated by the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced and secreted by the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal gland."

      - text: "Kidney crystals are solid clusters of :"
        options:
              - "Calcium nitrate and uric acid"

              - "Clacium carbonate and uric acid"
              - "Calcium metabisulphite and uric acid"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Kidney crystals are commonly referred to as renal calculi or kidney stones. These are insoluble masses formed by the crystallization of various salts within the kidney. While the source generally mentions 'oxalate etc.', common types of kidney stones often include calcium salts (like calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate) and uric acid stones. Therefore, a combination of 'Phosphate and uric acid' represents a plausible composition of kidney crystals."

        options:
              - "Cholesterol"
              - "Urochrome"
              - "Uric acid"
              - "Melanin"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The normal pale yellow color of urine is attributed to a pigment called urochrome. Urochrome is a metabolic byproduct resulting from the breakdown of hemoglobin, and its concentration influences the intensity of the urine's yellow hue."

      - text: "Which one of the four parts mentioned below does not constitute a part of a single uriniferous tubule:"
        options:
              - "Bowman’s capsule"
              - "Distal convoluted tubule"
              - "Loop of Henle"
              - "Collecting duct"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The uriniferous tubule, or nephron, is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. It comprises the Glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT), Loop of Henle, and Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT). The collecting duct is a separate structure that receives urine from multiple nephrons, eventually merging to form larger ducts. While functionally linked to urine formation, it is not considered part of a *single* nephron."

      - text: "Diuresis s a specific pathological condition which lead to :"
        options:
              - "Increased volume of urine excretion"
              - "Decreased volume of urine excretion"
              - "Increased glucose excretion"
              - "Decreased electrolyte concentration"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Diuresis refers to a physiological state characterized by an increased volume of urine excretion. This can be induced by diuretic substances (like coffee or alcohol) that inhibit water reabsorption, or by certain medical conditions (like diabetes mellitus causing osmotic diuresis)."

      - text: "Which one of the following pair of waste substances is removed from blood in ornithine cycle :"
        options:

              - "CO₂ and ammonia"
              - "Urea and sodium salt"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The ornithine cycle (urea cycle) is the biochemical pathway in the liver that detoxifies harmful nitrogenous waste. It utilizes ammonia (NH₃), which is the first metabolic waste product of protein metabolism, and carbon dioxide (CO₂) to synthesize urea. Thus, these two specific waste substances are effectively removed from the blood via their conversion into urea in this cycle."

              - "Blood cancer"
              - "Blood poisoning"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Haematuria is defined as the presence of blood in the urine. This condition signals an abnormal passage of red blood cells into the urinary tract, as they are normally retained during glomerular filtration."

      - text: "In the kidney, the formation of urine involve the following processes arranged as"
        options:
              - "Glomerular filtration, reabsorption and tubular secretion"

              - "Secretion, absorption and filtration"
              - "Filtration, secretion and reabsorption"
        correct: 0
        explanation:
              "Urine formation in the kidney is a precisely ordered process consisting of three main steps:
              1.  Glomerular Filtration: The initial step where blood plasma is filtered in the glomerulus.
              2.  Tubular Reabsorption: Essential substances are selectively reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the blood.
              3.  Tubular Secretion: Waste products and excess ions are actively secreted from the blood into the filtrate.
              This sequence ensures efficient waste removal and maintenance of body fluid homeostasis."

      - text: "An advantage of excreting nitrogenous wastes in the form of uric acid is that :"
        options:
              - "Uric acid can be excreted in almost solid form"
              - "The formation of uric acid requires a great deal of energy"
              - "Uric and is the first metabolic breakdown products of acids"
              - "Uric acid may be excreted through the lungs"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Uricotelism (excretion of uric acid) is a significant adaptation for water conservation, especially in terrestrial vertebrates laying shelled eggs, reptiles, and birds. The primary advantage is that uric acid can be passed out almost in the form of a precipitate because it is almost insoluble in water. This allows for minimum loss of water during excretion, which is crucial in arid environments or for embryos within shelled eggs where toxic nitrogenous wastes cannot diffuse out."

      - text: "If Henle's loop were absent from mammalian nephron. Which of the following is to be expected–"
        options:
              - "The urine will be more in volume"
              - "There will be no urine formation"
              - "There will be hardly any change in the quality and quantity of urine formed"
              - "The urine will be more concentrated"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The Loop of Henle is essential for establishing and maintaining the osmotic gradient in the renal medulla, a process critical for concentrating urine. If this structure were absent, the kidney's ability to reabsorb significant amounts of water would be severely compromised. Consequently, the kidney would produce a large volume of more dilute urine, leading to excessive water loss from the body. Therefore, the urine will be more in volume."

      - text: "A conditon of failure of kidney to form urine is called–"
        options:
              - "Deamination"

              - "Anuria"
              - "None of these"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Anuria is the medical term used to describe a severe condition where the kidneys fail to produce or excrete urine. *This specific term's definition is not explicitly present in the provided source's list of kidney disorders, but it is a standard medical term that describes the complete cessation of urine production.*"

      - text: "What is the characteristic of metanephric kidney–"
        options:
              - "Hypotonic urine production"
              - "Excess secretion of uric acid"
              - "Loop of Henle"
              - "Hormone production"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The source describes metanephric kidneys as the most advanced type of kidneys, which are found in reptiles, birds, and mammals. A defining characteristic of these advanced kidneys is the presence of the Loop of Henle. The Loop of Henle is crucial for the kidney's ability to produce concentrated, hypertonic urine, which is a significant adaptation for terrestrial life."

      - text: "The hormone sereted by kidney is–"
        options:
              - "Gastrin"
              - "Secretin"
              - "Erythropoietin"
              - "Aldosterone"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "While the kidney produces various substances involved in its own regulation (like renin), it also secretes hormones that affect other body systems. One such hormone, though not extensively detailed in the main text of this source, is Erythropoietin. This can be inferred from its appearance as an option in Q.14 of the Self-Assess section, indicating its relevance in kidney-related physiology. Erythropoietin stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow in response to hypoxia. *The direct statement 'kidney produces erythropoietin' is not explicitly present in the main explanatory text, but can be inferred from its inclusion in a multiple-choice option related to kidney function.*"

        options:
              - "Rohu and frog"
              - "Lizard and crow"
              - "Camel and frog"
              - "Earthworm and eagle"
        correct: 1
        explanation:
              "Uricotelic animals are those whose main excretory product is uric acid. The sources provide examples of uricotelic organisms:
              *   Reptiles: E.g., lizard.
              *   Birds: E.g., crow (and eagle).
              *   Insects: E.g., cockroach.
              Therefore, Lizard and crow correctly represent a pair of uricotelic animals."

      - text: "Marine teleosts, undergoing putrefaction, emit sharp characteristic foul odour, which is due to the production of–"
        options:
              - "Trimethylamine"

              - "Ammonia"
              - "Lactic Acid"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The source mentions that some animals convert highly toxic ammonia (NH₃) into less toxic trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) and retain high concentrations of TMAO to minimize water loss. While not explicitly stated in the source, Trimethylamine (TMA) is a well-known compound produced when TMAO in marine fish undergoes bacterial breakdown (putrefaction) after death, causing the characteristic 'fishy' odor. *This explanation draws on general biological and chemical knowledge as the specific link between TMAO breakdown and foul odor is not detailed in the provided sources.*"

      - text: "Fresh water bony fishes maintain water balance by–"
        options:
              - "Excreting a hypotonic urine"
              - "Excreting salt across their gills"
              - "Drinking small amount of water"
              - "Excreting wastes in the form of uric acid"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Freshwater bony fish live in an environment where the surrounding water has a lower solute concentration than their body fluids. This causes water to constantly move into their bodies via osmosis, and salts to diffuse out. To maintain water balance (osmoregulate), they counteract water gain by excreting a large volume of very dilute (hypotonic) urine and actively absorbing salts from the water through specialized cells in their gills. They generally do not drink water. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge as these specific osmoregulation mechanisms for freshwater bony fish are not detailed in the provided sources.*"

              - "None of these"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Let's examine each pair:
              *   Bowman's capsule - Glomerular filtration: Correct. Bowman's capsule is the site where glomerular filtration (ultrafiltration) occurs.
              *   PCT - Absorption of Na+ and K+: Correct. The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is a major site for the active reabsorption of essential substances, including Na+ and K+.
              *   DCT - Absorption of glucose: This is mismatched. Glucose is almost entirely reabsorbed in the Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT), not the Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT)."

              - "Digestive system"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The Loop of Henle is an integral part of the nephron (also called uriniferous tubule), which is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. The kidney, in turn, is the central organ of the excretory system responsible for urine formation and waste elimination."

      - text: "The complete reabsorption of glucose takes place in -"

              - "Proximal convoluted tubule"
              - "Henle loop"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is highly specialized for reabsorption and is the major site where essential substances are recovered from the glomerular filtrate. The source states that the whole of glucose is reabsorbed in the PCT, meaning under normal physiological conditions, no glucose should be found in the urine."

      - text: "Which of the following is metabolic waste of protein metabolism : -"
        options:
              - "NH₃, urea and CO₂"
              - "Urea, oxygen and N₂"
              - "Urea, ammonia and alanine"
              - "Urea, ammonia and creatinine"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Protein metabolism involves the breakdown of amino acids. This process initially produces ammonia (NH₃) through deamination. Ammonia is then converted to urea in the liver for safer transport and excretion. Creatinine is another nitrogenous waste product derived from the metabolism of creatine phosphate in muscles, which is also linked to protein metabolism. Therefore, urea, ammonia, and creatinine are all significant metabolic wastes of protein metabolism."

              - "Blood with proteins but without cells"
              - "Blood without urea"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Glomerular filtration is a nonselective process that allows small molecules to pass through the filtration barrier but retains large ones. The resulting glomerular filtrate is chemically similar to blood plasma but specifically excludes large-sized components such as blood cells (platelets, leucocytes, erythrocytes) and proteins. Therefore, it can be accurately described as blood without blood cells and proteins."

              - "Glomerulus or uriniferous tubule"
              - "Malpighian tubule"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The glomerular hydrostatic pressure (GHP) refers to the blood pressure within the capillaries of the glomerulus. This pressure is the main driving force that pushes fluid and small solutes out of the blood and into Bowman's capsule during glomerular filtration. The glomerulus is an integral part of the uriniferous tubule system (nephron)."

              - "Decrease in urine volume"
              - "Decrease in ionic balance"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Diuresis is a physiological state or condition where there is an increase in the volume of urine excreted. This can be caused by substances (diuretics) that inhibit water reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to higher urine output."

      - text: "Liquid which collects in the cavity of Bowmans’ Capsule is :-"

              - "Urea"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The liquid that collects in the lumen or capsular space of Bowman's capsule is the glomerular filtrate. This filtrate is formed through ultrafiltration of blood and is chemically similar to blood plasma, but it specifically lacks large molecules like blood proteins and blood cells, as these components are retained in the bloodstream. So, it is essentially blood plasma minus blood proteins."

      - text: "Mammalain kidney resemble contractile vacuole of Amoeba in excretion of :"

              - "Urea"
              - "Ammonia"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Both the mammalian kidney and the contractile vacuole of Amoeba serve a crucial function in osmoregulation, which is the maintenance of water balance. In freshwater Amoeba, the contractile vacuole actively pumps out excess water that enters the cell by osmosis from the hypotonic environment, preventing lysis. Similarly, mammalian kidneys play a vital role in regulating body fluid volume by excreting excess water (or conserving it as needed), thereby maintaining internal osmotic balance. *This explanation draws on general biological knowledge regarding osmoregulation in different organisms as the specific comparison is not detailed in the provided sources.*"

              - "None of the above"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone), also known as Vasopressin, is a key hormone in the regulation of water balance. It primarily acts on the walls of the collecting tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney. In the presence of ADH, these segments become permeable to water, facilitating its reabsorption from the filtrate and leading to the formation of more concentrated urine."

              - "The cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus of kidney"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The enzyme renin is a crucial component of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which regulates blood pressure and volume. Renin is specifically released by the cells of the Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA), which are specialized cells located in the kidney, in response to a decrease in blood pressure or volume in the afferent arteriole."

              - "Proximal convoluted tubule"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Let's review where reabsorption of Na+ and K+ occurs:
              *   Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): Active reabsorption of Na+ and K+ is significant.
              *   Loop of Henle: The thick ascending segment actively transports NaCl (and K+) out.
              *   Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Na+ is actively reabsorbed under the influence of aldosterone.
              *   Bowman's capsule: This structure is primarily involved in glomerular filtration, where blood plasma is filtered into the capsular space. It is not a site for the reabsorption (absorption) of ions. Therefore, absorption of Na+ and K+ ions does not occur in Bowman’s capsule."

              - "Liver"
              - "Kidney"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The synthesis of urea from ammonia (NH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) occurs through the urea cycle (ornithine cycle). This metabolic pathway is primarily localized to the liver. Once synthesized, urea is then transported via the bloodstream to the kidneys for filtration and excretion."

              - "has low sugar level in blood"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Glycosuria is explicitly defined as the presence of glucose in urine. It typically occurs when blood glucose levels are elevated, exceeding the renal tubules' capacity to reabsorb all the filtered glucose."

              - "The glomerular filtration rate is about 125mL per minute"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Let's evaluate each statement regarding urine formation:
              *   Tubular secretion takes place in the PCT (and DCT). (Correct)
              *   Aldosterone induces greater reabsorption of sodium in the DCT. (Correct)
              *   The counter-current mechanism is crucial for concentrating the urine, not diluting it. It achieves this by establishing and maintaining a high osmotic gradient in the renal medulla, which facilitates water reabsorption from the collecting ducts. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.
              *   The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is indeed about 125 mL per minute. (Correct)."

              - "RBC collapses and Urine production increases"
              - "RBC collapses and Urine production decreases"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Introducing one liter of pure water into human blood would significantly dilute the plasma, making it hypotonic (lower solute concentration). This hypotonicity would cause red blood cells (RBCs) to swell as water moves into them by osmosis. Severe swelling can lead to RBC lysis (bursting), not collapsing (which is typically shriveling in hypertonic solutions). The decrease in blood osmolarity would inhibit ADH release, leading to reduced water reabsorption in the kidneys and consequently a significant increase in urine production. *Note: The option states 'RBC collapses', which is biologically inaccurate for a hypotonic solution; however, 'Urine production increases' is correct, and I must adhere to the provided answer key.*"

              *   Human: Kidneys, sebaceous glands, and lungs are excretory organs. Tear glands are not listed. (Incorrect)
              *   Earthworm: As an annelid, the main excretory structures are nephridia. Earthworms possess different types of nephridia (pharyngeal, integumentary, and septal), which collectively handle excretion. This statement is correct.
              *   Cockroach: As an insect, its main excretory organs are Malpighian tubules. Enteric caeca are parts of the digestive system, not primary excretory organs. (Incorrect)
              *   Frog: Adult frogs use kidneys for excretion. While skin (for gas exchange and some waste) and buccal epithelium (for gas exchange) contribute to overall body functions, the primary specialized excretory organs are the kidneys. (Less precisely correct compared to Earthworm).
              Therefore, the Earthworm option is the most accurately stated."

      - text: "Urea synthesis takes place primarily in liver because :"
        options:
              - "Enzyme arginase is present in liver only."
              - "NH₃ and CO₂ are present in liver only."
              - "Hormone ADH is found in liver only."
              - "Kidney is smaller than liver."
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Urea is produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide in the liver. This process, the urea cycle, requires a specific set of enzymes. The primary reason urea synthesis takes place predominantly in the liver is that the entire enzymatic machinery for the urea cycle, including key enzymes like arginase, is exclusively or primarily present in liver cells. This allows for efficient detoxification of ammonia into urea before it is transported to the kidneys for excretion. *This explanation draws on general biochemical knowledge as the specific enzymes of the urea cycle are not detailed in the provided sources, though the source does state urea is produced in the liver.*"

      - text: "Which one of the following correctly explains the function of a specific part of a human nephron?"
        options:
              - "Podocytes : create minute spaces (slite pores) for the filtration of blood into the Bowman's capsule."
              - "Henle's loop : most reabsorption of the major substances from the glomerular filtrate."
              - "Distal convoluted tubule : reabsorption of K+ ions into the surrounding blood capillaries."
              - "Afferent arteriole : carries the blood away from the glomerular towards renal vein."
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Let's evaluate each option:
              *   Podocytes: These specialized cells in Bowman's capsule have pedicels that form slit pores or filtration slits, through which filterable components of blood pass into the capsule during ultrafiltration. This statement is correct.
              *   Henle's loop: The Loop of Henle's primary role is to establish a concentration gradient in the medulla and concentrate the filtrate, not to perform most reabsorption. The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is the major site of reabsorption. (Incorrect)
              *   Distal convoluted tubule: While the DCT is involved in ion transport and fine-tuning, its primary role concerning K+ is often secretion to eliminate excess K+ from the body, rather than extensive reabsorption into capillaries. (Ambiguous/Potentially incorrect depending on context of K+ balance)
              *   Afferent arteriole: This vessel carries blood to the glomerulus, not away from it towards the renal vein. The efferent arteriole carries blood away from the glomerulus. (Incorrect)"

        options:
              - "Reptiles and Bird"
              - "Birds and Annelids"
              - "Amphibians and Reptiles"
              - "Insects and Amphibians"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Uricotelism is a mode of excretion where the main nitrogenous waste product is uric acid. This adaptation is particularly important for water conservation, especially for terrestrial animals. The sources explicitly list reptiles and birds as examples of uricotelic animals, along with insects like cockroaches."

      - text: "Ureters act as urogenital ducts in :"
        options:
              - "human males"
              - "human females"
              - "frog's both males and females"
              - "frog's males"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The ureters are tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. In both human males and females, ureters exclusively transport urine. However, the question might refer to the broader urogenital system. In human males, the urethra (the tube that exits the urinary bladder) is a urogenital duct because it carries both urine and semen. In male amphibians (like frogs), the ureters (specifically, the Wolffian ducts) transport both urine from the kidneys and sperm from the testes, thus functioning as urogenital ducts. Given the options, and potential ambiguity, the answer key points to human males. While ureters themselves are not urogenital ducts in human males, the question might broadly refer to the male reproductive and urinary tract connection. *This question's interpretation is slightly ambiguous given the strict definition of ureters vs. urethra in the source, and common biological knowledge about male frog anatomy. Following the answer key for human males means interpreting the question very broadly to imply shared passage for urine and semen at some point in the male system, even if not directly the ureters.*"

      - text: "The maximum amount of electrolytes and water (70-80 percent) from the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed in which part of the nephron?"
        options:
              - "Distal convoluted tubule"
              - "Proximal convoluted tubule"
              - "Descending limb of loop of Henle"
              - "Ascending limb of loop of Henle"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is recognized as the major site of reabsorption in the nephron. Its highly specialized epithelial cells, equipped with brush borders and abundant mitochondria, enable efficient reabsorption. More than two-thirds (70-80%) of the essential electrolytes and water, along with all glucose and amino acids, are reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate in the PCT."

      - text: "Which one of the following options gives the correct categorisation of six animals according to the type of nitrogenous wastes (A, B, C) they give out ?"
        options:
              - "A. AMMONOTELIC: Pigeon, Humans; B. UREOTELIC: Aquatic Amphibia, Lizards; C. URICOTELIC: Cockroach, Frog"
              - "A. AMMONOTELIC: Frog, Lizards; B. UREOTELIC: Aquatic Amphibia, Humans; C. URICOTELIC: Cockroach, Pigeon"
              - "A. AMMONOTELIC: Aquatic Amphibia; B. UREOTELIC: Frog, Humans; C. URICOTELIC: Pigeon, Lizards, Cockroach"
              - "A. AMMONOTELIC: Aquatic Amphibia; B. UREOTELIC: Cockroach, Humans; C. URICOTELIC: Frog, Pigeon, Lizards"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Based on the modes of excretion defined in the sources:
              *   A. Ammonotelic (mainly ammonia): Examples include aquatic invertebrates (like Amoeba, Hydra), bony fish, and tadpole larvae of frogs (Aquatic Amphibia).
              *   B. Ureotelic (mainly urea): Examples include cartilaginous fish, adult amphibians (Frog), and mammals (Humans).
              *   C. Uricotelic (mainly uric acid): Examples include reptiles (Lizards), birds (Pigeon), and insects (Cockroach).
              Therefore, the correct categorization is: Ammonotelic - Aquatic Amphibia; Ureotelic - Frog, Humans; Uricotelic - Pigeon, Lizards, Cockroach."

        options:
              - "juxta glomerular cells to release renin"
              - "adrenal cortex to release aldosterone"

              - "posterior pituitary to release vasopressin"
        correct: 0
        explanation: "A fall in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) indicates a decrease in blood pressure or blood volume reaching the glomerulus. This change is detected by the juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells), which are specialized cells of the Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA) located in the afferent arteriole. In response, the JG cells release the enzyme renin into the bloodstream, initiating a cascade (RAAS) to restore GFR and blood pressure."

      - text: "Which one of the following characteristics is common both in humans and adult frogs?"
        options:
              - "Four - chambered heart"
              - "Internal fertilisation"
              - "Nucleated RBCs"
              - "Ureotelic mode of excretion"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Let's compare the characteristics:
              *   Four-chambered heart: Humans have a four-chambered heart, but adult frogs (amphibians) have a three-chambered heart. (Incorrect)
              *   Internal fertilisation: Humans have internal fertilization. Frogs typically exhibit external fertilization. (Incorrect)
              *   Nucleated RBCs: Humans have enucleated (non-nucleated) red blood cells. Frogs, like most other vertebrates except mammals, have nucleated red blood cells. (Incorrect)
              *   Ureotelic mode of excretion: Both humans (mammals) and adult frogs (amphibians) are classified as ureotelic, meaning their primary nitrogenous waste product is urea. This characteristic is common to both."

      - text: "Figure shows human urinary system with structures labelled A to D. Select option which correctly identifies them and gives their characteristics and/or functions."
        options:
              - "B - Pelvis - broad funnel shaped space inner to hilum, directly connected to loops of Henle."
              - "C - Medulla - inner zone of kidney and contains complete nephrons."
              - "D - Cortex - outer part of kidney and do not contain any part of nephrons."
              - "A - Adrenal gland - located at the anterior part of kidney. Secrete Catecholamines which stimulate glycogen breakdown."
        correct: 3
        explanation:
              "*Assuming the typical diagrammatic representation where A is the adrenal gland, B is the renal pelvis, C is the renal medulla, and D is the renal cortex:*
              *   (1) B - Pelvis: It is a broad funnel-shaped space inner to the hilum. However, it is not directly connected to loops of Henle, which are located primarily in the medulla and are parts of nephrons.
              *   (2) C - Medulla: It is the inner part of the kidney. It contains parts of nephrons like Loops of Henle and collecting ducts, but not complete nephrons (which also include structures like Bowman's capsule and PCT located in the cortex).
              *   (3) D - Cortex: It is the outer part of the kidney. It contains significant parts of nephrons, including Bowman's capsules, PCTs, and DCTs. Thus, it is incorrect to state it does not contain any part of nephrons.
              *   (4) A - Adrenal gland: Adrenal glands are indeed located at the anterior (superior) part of the kidneys. These glands produce various hormones, including catecholamines (like adrenaline and noradrenaline), which are known to stimulate glycogen breakdown as part of the 'fight or flight' response. *While the source mentions the adrenal gland releasing aldosterone in the context of kidney regulation, the specific function of catecholamines in glycogen breakdown is general biological knowledge but consistent with adrenal gland function.* Therefore, this option provides the most accurate identification and characteristic."

      - text: "Which of the following causes an increase in sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule?"
        options:
              - "Decrease in aldosterone levels"
              - "Decrease in antidiuretic hormone levels"
              - "Increase in aldosterone levels"
              - "Increase in antidiuretic hormone levels"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The reabsorption of sodium ions (Na+) in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting ducts is largely regulated by the hormone aldosterone. When there is an increase in aldosterone levels, it stimulates the epithelial cells in the DCT to actively reabsorb more Na+ from the filtrate back into the blood. Water often follows Na+ passively, contributing to increased blood volume."

      - text: "Which of the following does not favour the formation of large quantities of dilute urine?"
        options:
              - "Caffeine"
              - "Renin"
              - "A trial-natriuretic factor"
              - "Alcohol"
        correct: 1
        explanation:
              "Let's analyze the effect of each factor on urine volume and concentration:
              *   Caffeine and Alcohol are known diuretics, meaning they increase urine output (large quantities of dilute urine) by inhibiting ADH. (Favor dilute urine)
              *   Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF) is released in response to high blood volume/pressure and acts to reduce blood volume by inhibiting renin and aldosterone release, and increasing Na+ and water excretion. This results in increased urine output, often dilute. (Favors dilute urine)
              *   Renin initiates the RAAS, which ultimately leads to increased reabsorption of Na+ and water. This process works to conserve water and increase blood volume, thereby promoting the formation of smaller quantities of concentrated urine, not large quantities of dilute urine. Therefore, renin does not favour the formation of large quantities of dilute urine."

      - text: "Removal of proximal convoluted tubule from the nephron will result in"
        options:
              - "More concentrated urine"
              - "No change in quality and quantity of urine"
              - "No urine formation"
              - "More diluted urine"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is the primary site of reabsorption in the nephron, responsible for reabsorbing the majority (70-80%) of essential electrolytes, water, and all filtered glucose and amino acids from the glomerular filtrate. If the PCT were removed, this massive reabsorption would not occur. Consequently, a large volume of filtrate containing valuable solutes would pass through the rest of the nephron relatively unchanged, leading to significantly more diluted urine and severe dehydration due to excessive water and solute loss."
