              - "National Parks"
              - "Wildlife Sanctuaries"
              - "Sacred Groves"
              - "Biosphere Reserves"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In many cultures, tracts of forest were set aside, and all the trees and wildlife within were venerated and given total protection. Such **sacred groves** are found in various regions of India."

      - text: "Which of the following is **not** an example of an *ex situ* conservation method?"
        options:
              - "Maintaining threatened species in zoological parks and botanical gardens."
              - "Cryopreservation of gametes."
              - "Protecting a biodiversity hotspot like the Western Ghats."
              - "Propagating plants using tissue culture methods."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "**Protecting a biodiversity hotspot** is an example of **in situ conservation** because it involves protecting species within their natural habitat. The other options are *ex situ* methods."

      - text: "What was the primary call to action from the historic Convention on Biological Diversity ('The Earth Summit') held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992?"
        options:

              - "To fund bioprospecting initiatives globally."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The historic Convention on Biological Diversity ('The Earth Summit') held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, **called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilisation of its benefits**."

      - text: "At the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002, what commitment did 190 countries pledge to achieve by 2010?"

        correct: 2
        explanation: "In a follow-up, the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa, **190 countries pledged their commitment to achieve by 2010, a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, regional and local levels**."

      - text: "If we consider the problem of completing the inventory of biological wealth in India, which of the following is highlighted as a major challenge?"
        options:
              - "Lack of funding for taxonomic research."
              - "Difficulty in accessing remote areas."
              - "The immense trained manpower (taxonomists) and time required, coupled with the threat of species becoming extinct before discovery."
              - "Lack of international cooperation."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The situation appears more hopeless when we realise that a large fraction of these species faces the threat of becoming extinct even before we discover them, in addition to the **immense trained manpower (taxonomists) and the time required to complete the job**."

      - text: "Why might a stable biological community not show too much variation in productivity from year to year?"

              - "It has very few species."
              - "It is resistant or resilient to occasional disturbances (natural or man-made)."

              - "It lacks diverse trophic levels."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "A stable community should not show too much variation in productivity from year to year; it must be either **resistant or resilient to occasional disturbances (natural or man-made)**, and it must also be resistant to invasions by alien species."
