      - text: "Genetic engineering is defined as techniques to:"
        options:
              - "Maintain sterile ambience in chemical engineering processes."
              - "Grow desired microbes in large quantities."

        correct: 2
        explanation: "Genetic engineering: Techniques to alter the chemistry of genetic material (DNA and RNA), to introduce these into host organisms and thus change the phenotype of the host organism."

      - text: "What is the primary advantage of genetic engineering techniques over traditional hybridisation procedures in plant and animal breeding?"
        options:
              - "Genetic engineering allows for the inclusion and multiplication of undesirable genes."
              - "Traditional hybridisation is more precise in gene transfer."
              - "Genetic engineering permits isolation and introduction of only one or a set of desirable genes without introducing undesirable genes."
              - "Traditional hybridisation is a faster process."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Traditional hybridisation procedures used in plant and animal breeding, very often lead to inclusion and multiplication of undesirable genes along with the desired genes. The techniques of genetic engineering... overcome this limitation and allows us to isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without introducing undesirable genes into the target organism."

      - text: "For an alien piece of DNA to multiply itself in a host organism's progeny cells, it must become part of a chromosome that has a specific DNA sequence called the:"

              - "Terminator sequence"
              - "Origin of replication"
              - "Recognition sequence"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Most likely, this piece of DNA would not be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism. But, when it gets integrated into the genome of the recipient, it may multiply and be inherited along with the host DNA. This is because the alien piece of DNA has become part of a chromosome, which has the ability to replicate. In a chromosome there is a specific DNA sequence called the origin of replication, which is responsible for initiating replication."

      - text: "The construction of the first artificial recombinant DNA molecule in 1972 involved linking an antibiotic resistance gene with a native plasmid of which bacterium?"

      - text: "How are restriction enzymes typically named, such as EcoRI?"
        options:
              - "Genus, species, strain, and order of isolation."
              - "Species, genus, strain, and alphabetical order."
              - "Based on their cutting site sequence."
              - "Randomly assigned numbers."
        correct: 0
        explanation: "The convention for naming these enzymes is the first letter of the name comes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of the prokaryotic cell from which they were isolated, e.g., EcoRI comes from Escherichia coli RY 13. In EcoRI, the letter ‘R’ is derived from the name of strain. Roman numbers following the names indicate the order in which the enzymes were isolated from that strain of bacteria."

      - text: "Which statement best describes the function of restriction endonucleases?"
        options:
              - "They remove nucleotides from the ends of DNA."
              - "They join DNA fragments together."
              - "They cut DNA at specific positions within the DNA by recognising palindromic nucleotide sequences."
              - "They replicate DNA molecules."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Endonucleases make cuts at specific positions within the DNA. Each restriction endonuclease recognises a specific palindromic nucleotide sequences in the DNA. Once it finds its specific recognition sequence, it will bind to the DNA and cut each of the two strands of the double helix at specific points in their sugar-phosphate backbones."

      - text: "What are 'sticky ends' in the context of DNA fragments cut by restriction enzymes?"
        options:
              - "Single-stranded portions at the ends of DNA fragments that form hydrogen bonds with complementary cut counterparts."
              - "The blunt ends left after restriction enzyme digestion."
              - "Segments of DNA that are resistant to enzyme action."
              - "The recognition sequences for restriction enzymes."
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Restriction enzymes cut the strand of DNA a little away from the centre of the palindrome sites, but between the same two bases on the opposite strands. This leaves single stranded portions at the ends. There are overhanging stretches called sticky ends on each strand. These are named so because they form hydrogen bonds with their complementary cut counterparts."

      - text: "DNA fragments resulting from restriction endonuclease digestion can be separated by a technique called:"
        options:
              - "PCR"
              - "Electrophoresis"
              - "Centrifugation"
              - "Chromatography"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The cutting of DNA by restriction endonucleases results in the fragments of DNA. These fragments can be separated by a technique known as gel electrophoresis."

      - text: "During gel electrophoresis, why do DNA fragments move towards the anode?"
        options:
              - "Because they are positively charged molecules."
              - "Because they are negatively charged molecules."
              - "Due to the sieving effect of the gel matrix."
              - "To escape the electric field."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Since DNA fragments are negatively charged molecules they can be separated by forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric field through a medium/matrix."

      - text: "In agarose gel electrophoresis, how do DNA fragments separate?"
        options:
              - "According to their charge-to-mass ratio."
              - "Based on their base composition."
              - "According to their size through sieving effect provided by the agarose gel, with smaller fragments moving farther."
              - "Based on their solubility in the gel."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The DNA fragments separate (resolve) according to their size through sieving effect provided by the agarose gel. Hence, the smaller the fragment size, the farther it moves."

      - text: "How are separated DNA fragments visualised in agarose gel electrophoresis?"
        options:
              - "Directly under visible light."
              - "After staining with ethidium bromide and exposure to UV radiation, showing bright orange bands."

              - "By adding a chromogenic substrate that produces colour."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The separated DNA fragments can be visualised only after staining the DNA with a compound known as ethidium bromide followed by exposure to UV radiation (you cannot see pure DNA fragments in the visible light and without staining). You can see bright orange coloured bands of DNA in a ethidium bromide stained gel exposed to UV light."

      - text: "What is 'elution' in the context of DNA fragment separation?"
        options:
              - "The process of staining DNA with ethidium bromide."

        explanation: "The following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning into a vector. (i) Origin of replication (ori)... (ii) Selectable marker... (iii) Cloning sites."

      - text: "What is the function of a 'selectable marker' in a cloning vector?"
        options:
              - "To initiate DNA replication."
              - "To provide multiple cloning sites."
              - "To identify and eliminate non-transformants and selectively permit the growth of transformants."
              - "To facilitate the cutting of DNA."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In addition to ‘ori’, the vector requires a selectable marker, which helps in identifying and eliminating non-transformants and selectively permitting the growth of the transformants."

      - text: "In the context of selectable markers, if a foreign DNA is ligated into the BamH I site of the tetracycline resistance gene in vector pBR322, what will be the result?"
        options:
              - "The recombinant plasmids will gain resistance to ampicillin."
              - "The recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance but can still be selected on ampicillin-containing medium."

              - "The plasmid will no longer be able to replicate."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The ligation of alien DNA is carried out at a restriction site present in one of the two antibiotic resistance genes. For example, you can ligate a foreign DNA at the BamH I site of tetracycline resistance gene in the vector pBR322. The recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance due to insertion of foreign DNA but can still be selected out from non-recombinant ones by plating the transformants on ampicillin containing medium."

      - text: "What is 'insertional inactivation' in the context of selectable markers?"

              - "The process of making a host cell competent for DNA uptake."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "In this, a recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of an enzyme, β-galactosidase. This results into inactivation of the gene for synthesis of this enzyme, which is referred to as insertional inactivation."

      - text: "How are recombinant colonies identified using the β-galactosidase system with a chromogenic substrate?"
        options:
              - "Recombinant colonies produce a blue colour."
              - "Non-recombinant colonies produce a blue colour, while recombinant colonies do not produce any colour."
              - "All colonies will be white."
              - "Only colonies with the insert will grow."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The presence of a chromogenic substrate gives blue coloured colonies if the plasmid in the bacteria does not have an insert. Presence of insert results into insertional inactivation of the β-galactosidase gene and the colonies do not produce any colour, these are identified as recombinant colonies."

      - text: "Which of the following is a naturally occurring plant pathogen that has been modified into a cloning vector for plants?"
        options:

              - "Protease enzymes"
              - "Strong acids"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "This is done by treating them with a specific concentration of a divalent cation, such as calcium, which increases the efficiency with which DNA enters the bacterium through pores in its cell wall. Recombinant DNA can then be forced into such cells by incubating the cells with recombinant DNA on ice, followed by placing them briefly at 420C (heat shock), and then putting them back on ice."

              - "All of the above"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "In a method known as micro-injection, recombinant DNA is directly injected into the nucleus of an animal cell. In another method, suitable for plants, cells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA in a method known as biolistics or gene gun. And the last method uses ‘disarmed pathogen’ vectors, which when allowed to infect the cell, transfer the recombinant DNA into the host."

        correct: 2
        explanation: "In almost all recombinant technologies, the ultimate aim is to produce a desirable protein. Hence, there is a need for the recombinant DNA to be expressed."

      - text: "What are bioreactors, and what is their typical volume capacity?"
        options:
              - "Small laboratory flasks used for initial gene cloning; up to 1 litre."
              - "Vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products; 100-1000 litres."
              - "Devices for separating DNA fragments; up to 50 litres."
              - "Equipment for conducting clinical trials; variable volume."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "To produce in large quantities, the development of bioreactors, where large volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required. Thus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products, individual enzymes, etc., using microbial plant, animal or human cells."

      - text: "Which of the following are components of a typical stirred-tank bioreactor?"
        options:
              - "Agitator system, oxygen delivery system, foam control system, temperature control system, pH control system, sampling ports."
              - "Only a heating element and a stirrer."
              - "Just a sealed vessel for anaerobic conditions."
              - "A simple flask without any control systems."
        correct: 0
        explanation: "If you look at the figure closely you will see that the bioreactor has an agitator system, an oxygen delivery system and a foam control system, a temperature control system, pH control system and sampling ports so that small volumes of the culture can be withdrawn periodically."

      - text: "What processes are collectively referred to as 'downstream processing'?"
        options:
              - "Identification and introduction of DNA into the host."
              - "Cutting of DNA at specific locations and amplification."
              - "Separation and purification of the biosynthesised product after the biosynthetic stage, followed by formulation and quality control."
              - "Making host cells competent for DNA uptake."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "After completion of the biosynthetic stage, the product has to be subjected through a series of processes before it is ready for marketing as a finished product. The processes include separation and purification, which are collectively referred to as downstream processing. The product has to be formulated with suitable preservatives. Such formulation has to undergo thorough clinical trials as in case of drugs. Strict quality control testing for each product is also required."
