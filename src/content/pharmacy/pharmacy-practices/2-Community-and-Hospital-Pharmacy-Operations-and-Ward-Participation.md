## Community Pharmacy Practice

### Importance and Scope of Community Pharmacy

- **Definition**: Provision of pharmaceutical care by pharmacists in primary healthcare settings. A drug store or medicine shop meeting public's medicine and healthcare needs.
- **Accessibility**: Community pharmacists are often the **most accessible healthcare professionals** to the public, frequently serving as the first point of contact due to easy access and free advice.
- **Potential Role**: Enormous potential to play a positive and useful role in the public healthcare system.
- **Global Context**:
     - **United States (USA)**: Pharmacist responsibility for safe and effective drug therapy, conducting prescription reviews, maintaining patient records, and providing counselling (established by OBRA-90, 1990).
     - **Canada**: Involved in professional dispensing, patient counselling, medication management review for seniors, and care for specific conditions (diabetes, hypertension, smoking cessation).
     - **Australia**: Professional dispensing, patient counselling, health screening, drug information, and Home Medicines Review (HMR) services. Pharmacy ownership is restricted to pharmacists, and location rules protect established pharmacies. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises essential medicines, acting as a de facto national formulary.
- **Indian Scenario**:
     - Historically, community pharmacies were seen predominantly as traders.
     - Over 500,000 retail medical stores exist, often managed by D Pharm qualified pharmacists.
     - Many pharmacists consider it a trade rather than a profession due to poor knowledge base, lack of training, confidence, and financial benefits.
     - **Changing Landscape**: With new Pharm D and M Pharm (Pharmacy Practice) graduates, a shift towards professional and pharmaceutical care services is expected.
     - Medical staff in pioneering institutions have shown enthusiastic support for clinical pharmacy services, including drug information and patient counselling.

### Medication Use Problems in India

- India faces significant drug-related problems due to:
     - Polypharmacy.
     - Drug duplication.
     - Underdosing.
     - Potential drug interactions.
     - Illiteracy and inadequate information about medication use.
- **Prescriber Issues**: High patient load leads to short consultation times (5-10 minutes), difficulty in clear diagnosis, and reliance on pharmaceutical company promotions for drug information. Tendency to prescribe by brand names (risk of duplication) and empirically treat infections.
- **Pharmacist Issues**: Traditionally limited professional services (counselling, labelling, doctor interaction) due to lack of knowledge, training, confidence, and financial benefits. Pharmacies may be managed by non-pharmacists.
- **Government Policies**: Main focus on industry (price control, licensing) rather than wise medicine use. Poor regulation of advertising and promotional claims. Lack of functional national ADR reporting system.
- **Patient Issues**: Majority of literate Indians cannot read English labels, leading to non-adherence.

### Professional Responsibilities of Community Pharmacists

- **Core Services**:
     - Processing prescriptions.
     - Dispensing prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines.
     - Making extemporaneous preparations and small-scale manufacturing.
     - Supplying traditional/alternative medicines.
- **Patient-Oriented Services**:
     - **Patient Counselling**: About medications, diet, lifestyle, administration technique, storage, side effects, interactions, and strategies to overcome problems. A widely accepted responsibility in developed countries.
     - **Responding to Minor Ailments**: Providing advice and referring patients to doctors when necessary.
     - **Medication Reviews**: Assessing appropriateness of medicines, identifying drug-related problems (DRPs), and optimizing therapy.
     - **Medication Adherence**: Identifying determinants, detecting non-adherence, and implementing intervention strategies.
     - **Drug Information**: Providing unbiased information to healthcare professionals and the public.
     - **Pharmacovigilance**: Monitoring and reporting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs).
     - **Health Promotion & Education**: Immunisation, vaccination programmes, disease prevention, and public health awareness (e.g., safe sexual practices, chronic disease prevention, poison prevention, smoking cessation).
     - **Health Screening Services**: Blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, diabetes detection.
     - **Maintaining Patient Medication Records**: Helps identify DRPs like non-adherence, interactions, and ADRs.
     - **Domiciliary Services**: Home visits for medication reviews (e.g., Australia's HMRs).
- **Collaboration**: Working with patients and other healthcare providers (e.g., doctors).
- **Research**: Participation in community pharmacy practice research to provide evidence for new initiatives in patient care.

### Management Aspects & Dispensing Procedures (Community Pharmacy)

- **Legal Requirements (India)**: Qualified person, 120 sq ft practice area, suitable racks for storing all schedule medicines, special storage for biologicals (vaccines, sera).
- **Records**: Maintenance of retail and wholesale drug store records.
- **Staffing (Australia Example)**: Pharmacist-owned, limited number of pharmacies per owner. At least one registered pharmacist must be present during opening hours. Support staff (assistants, technicians) are integral, with formal training and certification.
- **Quality Control (Australia Example)**: Quality Care Pharmacy Program (QCPP) ensures adherence to professional standards, including cold chain procedures for refrigerated products.
- **Dispensing & Labelling (General)**:
     - Legal requirement for labels with directions, patient name, pharmacy name.
     - Cautionary and advisory labels for side effects or interactions.
     - Dispensing technicians may prepare medications for pharmacist's final check.
     - Batch numbers and expiry dates for non-prescription or less-used medicines.
- **Reimbursement (Australia Example)**: Government pays dispensing fees and a mark-up on medication cost. Funding for professional services like HMRs and RMMRs is provided by the government.
- **Financial, Materials, Staff, Infrastructure Requirements**: These are key aspects of community pharmacy management, implicitly covered by the various operational descriptions and directly mentioned in the syllabus.

## Hospital Pharmacy Operations

### Hospital Classification and Organisation

- **Definition**: Hospitals are healthcare facilities providing inpatient services.
- **Classification (India)**:
     - **Primary**: Early management of patients, minor ailments. General physicians. May be called nursing homes in the private sector.
     - **Secondary**: Manage more complex cases, often referrals from primary care.
     - **Tertiary**: High-level specialised care, often teaching hospitals affiliated with medical schools.
