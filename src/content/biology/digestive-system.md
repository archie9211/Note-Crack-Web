The **digestive system** breaks down food into nutrients, which the body uses for energy, growth, and cell repair.

## Key Organs

- **Mouth**: Begins mechanical and chemical digestion.
- **Esophagus**: Transports food to stomach.
- **Stomach**: Secretes acid and enzymes; churns food.
- **Small Intestine**: Main site for nutrient absorption.
- **Large Intestine**: Absorbs water, forms feces.

## Key Points

- Enzymes speed up digestion.
- Peristalsis moves food along.
- Villi in the small intestine increase absorption area.
