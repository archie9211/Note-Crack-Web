# Human Reproduction: A Summary for Revision

## 1. Introduction to Human Reproduction

Humans are **sexually reproducing** and **viviparous** [1, 2]. Key reproductive events occur after puberty and include:

- **Gametogenesis:** Formation of gametes (sperms in males, ovum in females) [1, 3].
- **Insemination:** Transfer of sperms into the female genital tract [1, 4].
- **Fertilisation:** Fusion of male and female gametes, forming a zygote [1, 5].
- **Implantation:** Formation and development of a blastocyst and its attachment to the uterine wall [1, 6].
- **Gestation:** Embryonic development (pregnancy) [1, 7].
- **Parturition:** Delivery of the baby [8, 9].

**Key difference:** Sperm formation continues in old men, but ovum formation ceases in women around 50 years of age (menopause) [8, 10].

## 2. The Male Reproductive System

Located in the pelvis region .

### 2.1 Components:

- A pair of **testes** .
- Accessory ducts .
- Glands .
- External genitalia .

### 2.2 Testes:

- Situated outside the abdominal cavity within a pouch called the **scrotum** .
- **Scrotum function:** Helps maintain a low temperature (2-2.5°C lower than normal body temperature) necessary for **spermatogenesis** .
- **Structure:** Oval shape, about 4-5 cm length, 2-3 cm width . Covered by a dense covering .
- **Testicular Lobules:** Each testis has ~250 compartments .
- **Seminiferous Tubules:** Each lobule contains 1-3 highly coiled tubules where sperms are produced .
     - Lined by two cell types:
          - **Male germ cells (spermatogonia):** Undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation [12, 13].
          - **Sertoli cells:** Provide nutrition to the germ cells .
- **Interstitial Spaces (outside seminiferous tubules):**
     - Contain small blood vessels and **interstitial cells** or **Leydig cells** .
     - **Leydig cells function:** Synthesise and secrete **testicular hormones called androgens** [13, 14].
     - Also contain other immunologically competent cells .

### 2.3 Male Sex Accessory Ducts:

- Include **rete testis, vasa efferentia, epididymis, and vas deferens** .
- **Pathway of sperm transport:** Seminiferous tubules → rete testis → vasa efferentia → epididymis → vas deferens .
- **Vas deferens:** Ascends to the abdomen, loops over the urinary bladder, receives a duct from a seminal vesicle, and opens into the urethra as the **ejaculatory duct** .
- **Function:** Store and transport sperms from the testis to the outside through the **urethra** .
- **Urethra:** Originates from the urinary bladder, extends through the penis to its external opening (**urethral meatus**) [15, 16].

### 2.4 External Genitalia (Penis):

- Male external genitalia .
- Made of special tissue for **erection** to facilitate insemination .
- **Glans penis:** Enlarged end, covered by a loose fold of skin called **foreskin** [16, 17].

### 2.5 Male Accessory Glands:

- Paired **seminal vesicles** .
- A **prostate** gland .
- Paired **bulbourethral glands** .
- **Secretions:** Constitute the **seminal plasma** .
     - **Seminal plasma content:** Rich in **fructose, calcium, and certain enzymes** .
     - **Bulbourethral glands:** Secretions also help in **lubrication of the penis** .
- **Function of ducts and glands:** Store and transport sperms; secretions are essential for **maturation and motility of sperms** .
- **Semen:** Seminal plasma along with sperms .
- **Maintenance:** Functions are maintained by testicular hormones (androgens) .

## 3. The Female Reproductive System

Located in the pelvic region .

### 3.1 Components:

- A pair of **ovaries** .
- A pair of **oviducts** (fallopian tubes) [17, 21].
- **Uterus** .
- **Cervix** .
- **Vagina** .
- External genitalia .
- A pair of **mammary glands** (structurally and functionally integrated) [20, 22].

### 3.2 Ovaries:

- **Primary female sex organs** .
- **Function:** Produce the **female gamete (ovum)** and several **steroid hormones (ovarian hormones)** [20, 23].
- **Location:** One on each side of the lower abdomen .
- **Size:** About 2-4 cm in length .
- **Connection:** Connected to the pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments .
- **Structure:** Covered by a thin epithelium enclosing the **ovarian stroma** [20, 21].
     - Stroma divided into a **peripheral cortex** and an **inner medulla** .

### 3.3 Female Accessory Ducts:

- **Oviducts (Fallopian Tubes):** About 10-12 cm long, extend from ovary to uterus .
     - **Infundibulum:** Funnel-shaped part closer to the ovary .
     - **Fimbriae:** Finger-like projections on infundibulum edges, help in **collection of the ovum after ovulation** [14, 21].
     - **Ampulla:** Wider part of the oviduct, where fertilisation usually occurs [4, 24].
     - **Isthmus:** Last part, narrow lumen, joins the uterus .
- **Uterus (Womb):** Single, inverted pear shape . Supported by ligaments .
     - **Uterine Wall Layers:**
          - **Perimetrium:** External thin membranous layer .
          - **Myometrium:** Middle thick layer of smooth muscle, exhibits **strong contraction during delivery** [14, 25].
          - **Endometrium:** Inner glandular layer lining uterine cavity, undergoes **cyclical changes during menstrual cycle** [14, 25].
- **Cervix:** Narrow opening of the uterus into the vagina .
     - **Cervical Canal:** Cavity of the cervix .
- **Vagina:** Along with the cervical canal, forms the **birth canal** .

### 3.4 Female External Genitalia:

- Include **mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen, and clitoris** .
- **Mons pubis:** Cushion of fatty tissue covered by skin and pubic hair .
- **Labia majora:** Fleshy folds extending from mons pubis, surrounding vaginal opening .
- **Labia minora:** Paired folds under labia majora .
- **Hymen:** Membrane partially covering vaginal opening, can be torn by various activities (first coitus, fall, tampon insertion, sports) [26, 27]. **Not a reliable indicator of virginity** [14, 27].
- **Clitoris:** Tiny finger-like structure above urethral opening, at upper junction of labia minora .

### 3.5 Mammary Glands:

- Characteristic of all female mammals .
- Paired structures (breasts) containing glandular tissue and fat .
- **Glandular tissue:** Divided into 15-20 **mammary lobes**, each containing clusters of cells called **alveoli** .
     - **Alveoli function:** Secrete milk, which is stored in their lumens .
- **Duct System:** Alveoli → mammary tubules → mammary duct → wider mammary ampulla → lactiferous duct → opens at the **nipple** for milk expression during breastfeeding [3, 22].

## 4. Gametogenesis

The process of gamete formation by primary sex organs .

### 4.1 Spermatogenesis (Sperm Formation in Testis):

- Initiated at **puberty** .
- **Hormonal Regulation:**
     - Increased **Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH)** from hypothalamus .
     - GnRH acts on anterior pituitary, stimulating **Luteinising Hormone (LH)** and **Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)** secretion .
     - **LH:** Acts on Leydig cells, stimulating synthesis and secretion of **androgens**, which in turn stimulate spermatogenesis .
     - **FSH:** Acts on Sertoli cells, stimulating secretion of factors that help in **spermiogenesis** .
- **Process:**
     1.    **Spermatogonia** (immature male germ cells, diploid, 46 chromosomes) multiply by mitotic division [3, 30].
     2.    Some spermatogonia become **primary spermatocytes** .
     3.    Primary spermatocytes undergo **Meiosis I** (reduction division) → two equal, haploid **secondary spermatocytes** (23 chromosomes each) .
     4.    Secondary spermatocytes undergo **Meiosis II** → four equal, haploid **spermatids** [28, 30].
     5.    **Spermiogenesis:** Spermatids transform into **spermatozoa (sperms)** .
     6.    **Spermiation:** After spermiogenesis, sperm heads embed in Sertoli cells and are finally released from seminiferous tubules .

### 4.2 Structure of a Sperm:

- Microscopic structure composed of a **head, neck, middle piece, and tail** .
- Enveloped by a plasma membrane .
- **Head:** Contains an elongated **haploid nucleus** .
     - Anterior portion covered by a cap-like structure, **acrosome** .
     - **Acrosome function:** Filled with enzymes that help **fertilisation of the ovum** [14, 31].
- **Middle Piece:** Possesses numerous **mitochondria**, which produce energy for tail movement .
- **Tail:** Facilitates **sperm motility**, essential for fertilisation [14, 31].
- **Normal Fertility:** For normal fertility, at least 60% of 200-300 million ejaculated sperms must have normal shape/size, and 40% must show vigorous motility .

### 4.3 Oogenesis (Ovum Formation in Ovary):

- Markedly different from spermatogenesis .
- **Initiation:** Begins during **embryonic development** stage .
     - A couple of million **gamete mother cells (oogonia)** are formed within each fetal ovary; **no more oogonia are formed after birth** .
- **Process:**
     1.    Oogonia start division and enter **prophase-I of meiotic division**, becoming temporarily arrested as **primary oocytes** .
     2.    Each primary oocyte gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells, forming a **primary follicle** .
     3.    Many follicles degenerate from birth to puberty; only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles remain per ovary at puberty .
     4.    Primary follicles get surrounded by more granulosa layers and a new theca, becoming **secondary follicles** .
     5.    Secondary follicle transforms into a **tertiary follicle**, characterised by a fluid-filled cavity called **antrum** . The theca layer organises into inner theca interna and outer theca externa .
     6.    At the tertiary follicle stage, the primary oocyte within it **grows in size and completes its first meiotic division** .
           - This is an **unequal division**, resulting in a **large haploid secondary oocyte** (retains bulk of nutrient-rich cytoplasm) and a tiny **first polar body** [33, 34].
     7.    The tertiary follicle further changes into the **mature follicle** or **Graafian follicle** .
     8.    The secondary oocyte forms a new membrane around it called **zona pellucida** .
     9.    **Ovulation:** The Graafian follicle ruptures to release the secondary oocyte (ovum) from the ovary [2, 35].

## 5. Menstrual Cycle

The reproductive cycle in female primates (monkeys, apes, humans) .

- **Menarche:** The first menstruation, beginning at puberty .
- **Menopause:** Menstrual cycles cease around 50 years of age .
- **Duration:** Average interval of about **28/29 days** .
- **Ovulation:** One ovum is released during the middle of each cycle (around day 14) .
- **Regulation:** Cyclical changes in the ovary and uterus are induced by changes in levels of **pituitary and ovarian hormones** [37, 38].

### 5.1 Phases of the Menstrual Cycle:

- **1. Menstrual Phase (Day 1-5):**
     - **Menstrual flow** occurs .
     - Results from **breakdown of the endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels** .
     - Occurs **only if the released ovum is not fertilised** .
     - Lack of menstruation can indicate pregnancy, but also stress, poor health, etc. .
- **2. Follicular Phase (Proliferative Phase):**
     - Follows menstrual phase .
     - Primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a fully mature Graafian follicle .
     - Simultaneously, the **endometrium of the uterus regenerates** through proliferation .
     - **Hormone changes:**
          - Secretion of **gonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually** .
          - Stimulates follicular development and **secretion of estrogens** by growing follicles .
- **3. Ovulatory Phase (around Day 14):**
     - Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of the cycle .
     - **LH Surge:** Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level .
     - **Induces rupture of Graafian follicle and release of ovum (ovulation)** [2, 40].
- **4. Luteal Phase (Secretory Phase):**
     - Follows ovulation .
     - Remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform into the **corpus luteum** [14, 40].
     - **Corpus luteum function:** Secretes large amounts of **progesterone**, which is essential for **maintenance of the endometrium** [14, 40].
     - This endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and pregnancy .
     - **During pregnancy, all menstrual cycle events stop and there is no menstruation** [10, 14].
     - **If fertilisation does not occur:** The corpus luteum degenerates, causing disintegration of the endometrium, leading to menstruation and marking a new cycle .

### 5.2 Menstrual Hygiene:

- Maintaining hygiene and sanitation is important during menstruation .
- Includes regular bathing, use of sanitary napkins/clean pads, changing them every 4-5 hours, and proper disposal .

## 6. Fertilisation and Implantation

### 6.1 Fertilisation:

- **Insemination:** Semen is released by the penis into the vagina during copulation .
- **Sperm Transport:** Motile sperms rapidly swim through the cervix, enter the uterus, and finally reach the **ampullary region of the fallopian tube** .
- **Ovum Transport:** The ovum released from the ovary is also transported to the **ampullary region** .
- **Occurrence:** Fertilisation can **only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region** [4, 41].
- **Process of fusion:**
     1.    A sperm contacts the **zona pellucida** layer of the ovum .
     2.    This induces changes in the membrane that **block the entry of additional sperms**, ensuring only one sperm fertilises the ovum .
     3.    Secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter the ovum's cytoplasm .
     4.    This entry induces the **completion of the meiotic division of the secondary oocyte** .
           - This second meiotic division is unequal, forming a **second polar body** and a **haploid ovum (ootid)** .
     5.    The haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum fuse to form a **diploid zygote** [41, 42].

### 6.2 Sex Determination:

- The **sex of the baby is decided at the stage of fertilisation** .
- Female chromosome pattern: XX; Male chromosome pattern: XY .
- Female gametes (ova) always carry X chromosome .
- Male gametes (sperms) carry either X (50%) or Y (50%) chromosome .
- **Zygote:**
     - **XX:** Develops into a **female baby** (if an X-sperm fertilises the ovum) [43, 44].
     - **XY:** Develops into a **male baby** (if a Y-sperm fertilises the ovum) [43, 44].
- **Conclusion:** Scientifically, the sex of the baby is determined by the **father**, not the mother .

### 6.3 Implantation:

- **Cleavage:** The zygote undergoes repeated **mitotic division** (called cleavage) as it moves through the isthmus towards the uterus .
     - Forms 2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called **blastomeres** .
- **Morula:** The embryo with 8 to 16 blastomeres .
- **Blastocyst:** The morula continues to divide and transforms into a blastocyst as it moves further into the uterus [41, 45].
     - **Blastomeres in blastocyst:** Arranged into an outer layer called **trophoblast** and an inner group of cells (attached to trophoblast) called the **inner cell mass** .
- **Attachment and Embedding:**
     1.    The trophoblast layer attaches to the endometrium .
     2.    The inner cell mass differentiates as the embryo .
     3.    Uterine cells divide rapidly, covering the blastocyst [6, 45].
     4.    Result: The blastocyst becomes **embedded in the endometrium of the uterus** .
- **Implantation leads to pregnancy** [6, 38].

## 7. Pregnancy and Embryonic Development

### 7.1 Placenta:

- After implantation, finger-like projections (**chorionic villi**) appear on the trophoblast .
- These villi are surrounded by uterine tissue and maternal blood .
- **Formation:** Chorionic villi and uterine tissue interdigitate, forming a structural and functional unit called the **placenta** [41, 46].
- **Functions:**
     - Facilitates supply of **oxygen and nutrients** to the embryo .
     - Removes **carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials** produced by the embryo .
     - Connected to the embryo through an **umbilical cord**, which aids substance transport .
- **Endocrine Tissue:** Placenta acts as an endocrine tissue, producing several hormones :
     - **Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)** .
     - **Human placental lactogen (hPL)** .
     - **Estrogens** .
     - **Progestogens** .
- **Other Hormones during Pregnancy:**
     - **Relaxin** (secreted by the ovary in later pregnancy) .
     - **hCG, hPL, and relaxin are produced only during pregnancy** .
     - Levels of estrogens, progestogens, cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine increase several-fold in maternal blood .
     - These increased hormones are essential for supporting **fetal growth, metabolic changes in the mother, and maintenance of pregnancy** .

### 7.2 Embryonic Development:

- **Germ Layers:** Immediately after implantation, the inner cell mass (embryo) differentiates into:
     - **Ectoderm** (outer layer) .
     - **Endoderm** (inner layer) .
     - **Mesoderm** (soon appears between ectoderm and end) .
     - These three germ layers give rise to **all tissues and organs** in adults .
- **Stem Cells:** The inner cell mass contains stem cells with the potency to give rise to all tissues and organs .
- **Gestation Period:** Human pregnancy lasts approximately **9 months** [7, 49].
- **Major Developmental Milestones:**
     - **After 1 month:** Embryo’s **heart is formed** (first sign noticed by stethoscope) .
     - **End of 2nd month:** Foetus develops **limbs and digits** .
     - **End of 12 weeks (First Trimester):** Most major organ systems are formed, limbs and external genital organs are well-developed .
     - **5th month:** First movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on the head .
     - **End of 24 weeks (End of Second Trimester):** Body covered with fine hair, eyelids separate, eyelashes formed .
     - **End of 9 months:** Foetus is fully developed and ready for delivery [7, 38].

## 8. Parturition and Lactation

### 8.1 Parturition (Childbirth):

- The process of **delivery of the foetus (childbirth)** [9, 38].
- Average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months (**gestation period**) .
- Induced by a **complex neuroendocrine mechanism** [9, 38].
- **Mechanism:**
     1.    Signals originate from the **fully developed foetus and the placenta** .
     2.    These induce mild uterine contractions called **foetal ejection reflex** .
     3.    This reflex triggers the release of **oxytocin from the maternal pituitary** .
     4.    **Oxytocin acts on the uterine muscle, causing stronger uterine contractions** .
     5.    Stronger contractions stimulate further oxytocin secretion, creating a **positive feedback loop** .
     6.    This leads to increasingly stronger contractions, expelling the baby out of the uterus through the **birth canal** .
     7.    Soon after the infant, the **placenta is also expelled** .

### 8.2 Lactation:

- The **mammary glands undergo differentiation during pregnancy** and start producing milk towards the end of pregnancy [50, 51].
- This process is called **lactation** and helps the mother feed the newborn [38, 51].
- **Colostrum:** The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation .
     - **Content:** Contains **several antibodies** essential to develop resistance for the newborn .
- **Importance:** Doctors recommend breast-feeding during the initial period of infant growth for bringing up a healthy baby .
