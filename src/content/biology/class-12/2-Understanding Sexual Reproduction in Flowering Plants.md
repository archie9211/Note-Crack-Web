- **Human-Flower Relationship:** Appreciate the aesthetic, ornamental, social, religious, and cultural significance of flowers.
- **Basic Floral Anatomy (Recall from previous knowledge):** Be able to recall and, if prompted, identify the main parts of a typical flower (e.g., sepals, petals, stamens, pistil).

### B. Pre-fertilisation: Structures and Events

#### Floral Development:

- **Initiation:** Understand that the decision to flower involves hormonal and structural changes.

#### Stamen, Microsporangium, and Pollen Grain (Male Reproductive Structures):

- **Stamen Anatomy:** Describe the two parts of a typical stamen: **filament** and **anther**. Note the variability in number and length.
- **Anther Structure:** Understand that a typical angiosperm anther is **bilobed** and **dithecous** (two theca per lobe), making it a four-sided (**tetragonal**) structure with four **microsporangia**.
- **Microsporangium Development:** Recognize that microsporangia develop into **pollen sacs**, filled with **pollen grains**.
- **Microsporangium Wall Layers:** List and describe the four wall layers:
     - **Epidermis, Endothecium, Middle Layers:** Functions in protection and **dehiscence** of the anther.
     - **Tapetum:** Innermost layer, nourishes developing pollen grains, typically has dense cytoplasm and multiple nuclei.
- **Sporogenous Tissue:** Identify this group of homogenous cells in the center of a young microsporangium.

#### Microsporogenesis:

- **Definition:** The process of microspore formation from a **pollen mother cell (PMC)** through meiosis.
- **Ploidy:** Understand that PMCs are diploid, and meiosis results in haploid microspore tetrads.
- **Pollen Grain Development:** Explain how microspores dissociate from the tetrad and develop into pollen grains as the anther matures and dehydrates.

#### Pollen Grain (Male Gametophyte):

- **Description:** Generally spherical, 25-50 micrometers in diameter, with a two-layered wall.
- **Exine:** Hard outer layer made of **sporopollenin** (most resistant organic material), which makes pollen grains good fossils and allows them to withstand harsh conditions. Note the presence of **germ pores** (where sporopollenin is absent).
- **Intine:** Inner, thin, continuous layer made of cellulose and pectin.
- **Cytoplasm and Cells:** Understand that mature pollen grains contain a **vegetative cell** (larger, food reserve, irregular nucleus) and a **generative cell** (smaller, spindle-shaped, dense cytoplasm, floats in vegetative cell cytoplasm).
- **Shedding Stage:** Differentiate between 2-celled (vegetative + generative) and 3-celled (vegetative + two male gametes) shedding stages.
- **Allergies:** Be aware that pollen grains from some species (e.g., _Parthenium_) can cause allergies and respiratory disorders.
- **Viability and Storage:** Understand the variable viability of pollen grains and the concept of pollen banks (storage in liquid nitrogen) for crop breeding.
- **Pollen Products:** Recognize pollen tablets/syrups as food supplements, claimed to enhance performance.

#### The Pistil, Megasporangium (Ovule), and Embryo Sac (Female Reproductive Structures):

- **Gynoecium:** Represents the female reproductive part.
- **Pistil Variations:** Differentiate between **monocarpellary**, **multicarpellary** (**syncarpous** and **apocarpous**) pistils.
- **Parts of a Pistil:** Identify the **stigma** (landing platform), **style** (elongated part), and **ovary** (basal bulged part containing **ovarian cavity/locule** and **placenta**).

#### Ovule (Megasporangium):

- **Protective Layers:** One or two **integuments** encircling the **nucellus**.
- **Micropyle:** Small opening at the tip of integuments.
- **Chalaza:** Basal part of the ovule, opposite the micropyle.
- **Nucellus:** Mass of cells enclosed by integuments, rich in reserve food materials. Contains the **embryo sac**.

#### Megasporogenesis:

- **Definition:** Formation of **megaspores** from a **megaspore mother cell (MMC)** through meiosis.
- **Location:** MMC differentiates in the micropylar region of the nucellus.
- **Outcome:** Meiosis results in four megaspores.

#### Female Gametophyte (Embryo Sac):

- **Monosporic Development:** In most flowering plants, only one megaspore is functional, developing into the embryo sac.
- **Embryo Sac Formation:** Detail the mitotic divisions of the functional megaspore nucleus (2-nucleate, 4-nucleate, 8-nucleate stages). Emphasize free nuclear divisions before cell wall formation.
- **Mature Embryo Sac Structure:** Describe its 7-celled, 8-nucleate nature:
     - **Egg Apparatus:** Three cells at the micropylar end: one **egg cell** and two **synergids**.
     - **Filiform Apparatus:** Special thickenings on synergids, guiding pollen tubes.
     - **Antipodals:** Three cells at the chalazal end.
     - **Central Cell:** Large cell with two **polar nuclei**.

### C. Pollination

- **Definition:** Transfer of pollen grains from anther to stigma.
- **Purpose:** To bring non-motile male and female gametes together for fertilisation.
- **Pollinating Agents:** Distinguish between abiotic (wind, water) and biotic (animals) agents.
- **Compensation for Uncertainty:** Explain why flowers produce enormous amounts of pollen when relying on abiotic agents.

#### Kinds of Pollination:

- **Autogamy:** Pollination within the same flower. Rare in normal open flowers, requires synchrony and proximity of anther/stigma.
     - **Chasmogamous Flowers:** Open, exposed anthers and stigma.
     - **Cleistogamous Flowers:** Do not open, anthers and stigma lie close, invariably autogamous, assured seed-set (e.g., _Viola_, _Oxalis_, _Commelina_). Discuss advantages/disadvantages.
- **Geitonogamy:** Transfer of pollen between different flowers on the same plant. Functionally cross-pollination, but genetically similar to autogamy.
- **Xenogamy:** Transfer of pollen between anther and stigma of different plants. Only type that brings genetically different pollen to the stigma.

#### Agents of Pollination (Detailed):

- **Wind Pollination:** Common among abiotic agents. Characteristics: light, non-sticky pollen; well-exposed stamens; large, feathery stigma; single ovule per ovary; numerous flowers in an inflorescence (e.g., corn cob, grasses). Not colorful, no nectar.
- **Water Pollination:** Rare, mostly monocotyledons (e.g., _Vallisneria_, _Hydrilla_, _Zostera_). Not all aquatic plants use water. Explain variations like _Vallisneria_ (female flowers reach surface, pollen floats) and seagrasses (flowers submerged, ribbon-like pollen). Pollen often protected by mucilaginous covering. Not colorful, no nectar.
- **Animal Pollination:** Majority of flowering plants. Common agents: bees, butterflies, flies, beetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds, bats. Even larger animals can be pollinators.
     - **Adaptations:** Flowers often large, colorful, fragrant, rich in nectar. Small flowers clustered into inflorescences. Foul odors for flies/beetles.
     - **Floral Rewards:** Nectar and pollen are common rewards.
     - **Special Relationships:** Examples like _Amorphophallus_ (safe place to lay eggs) and Yucca-moth (mutualistic relationship).

#### Outbreeding Devices:

Mechanisms to discourage self-pollination and encourage cross-pollination, preventing inbreeding depression.

- **Asynchrony:** Pollen release and stigma receptivity are not synchronized.
- **Positioning:** Anther and stigma placed at different positions.
- **Self-incompatibility:** Genetic mechanism preventing self-pollen germination or tube growth.
- **Unisexual Flowers:**
     - **Monoecious:** Male and female flowers on the same plant (prevents autogamy, not geitonogamy, e.g., castor, maize).
     - **Dioecious:** Male and female flowers on different plants (prevents both autogamy and geitonogamy, e.g., papaya).

#### Pollen-Pistil Interaction:

- **Recognition:** Pistil's ability to distinguish compatible from incompatible pollen, mediated by chemical dialogue.
- **Acceptance/Rejection:** Promotion of post-pollination events for compatible pollen; inhibition for incompatible pollen.
- **Pollen Tube Growth:** Germination of pollen grain on stigma, formation of **pollen tube** through germ pore. Pollen tube grows through stigma and style to reach ovary.
- **Gamete Delivery:** Generative cell divides (if not already) to form two male gametes. Pollen tube enters ovule via micropyle, then into a synergid (guided by filiform apparatus).

#### Artificial Hybridisation:

- **Purpose:** To combine desirable characters for superior varieties.
- **Techniques:**
     - **Emasculation:** Removal of anthers from bisexual flower buds before dehiscence to prevent self-pollination.
     - **Bagging:** Covering emasculated flowers (or female unisexual flowers) with a bag to prevent unwanted pollen contamination. Rebagging after desired pollination.

### D. Post-fertilisation: Structures and Events

#### Double Fertilisation: Unique to flowering plants.

- **Syngamy:** Fusion of one male gamete with the egg cell, forming a diploid **zygote**.
- **Triple Fusion:** Fusion of the other male gamete with the two polar nuclei in the central cell, forming a triploid **primary endosperm nucleus (PEN)**.
- **Products:** Zygote develops into **embryo**; **primary endosperm cell (PEC)** (formed from central cell after triple fusion) develops into **endosperm**.

#### Endosperm Development:

- **Precedes Embryo Development:** Provides nutrition.
- **Formation:** PEN divides repeatedly to form triploid endosperm tissue.
- **Types:**
     - **Free-nuclear endosperm:** PEN undergoes successive nuclear divisions without cell wall formation (e.g., coconut water).
     - **Cellular endosperm:** Cell wall formation occurs after free nuclear stage (e.g., coconut kernel).
- **Persistence:** May be completely consumed by embryo (**non-albuminous seeds**, e.g., pea, groundnut, beans) or persist in mature seed (**albuminous seeds**, e.g., castor, coconut, wheat, rice, maize).

#### Embryo Development:

- **Location:** Micropylar end of embryo sac.
- **Dormancy:** Zygote typically divides after endosperm formation (assured nutrition).
- **Stages (Dicotyledonous Embryo):** Zygote -> **proembryo** -> globular -> heart-shaped -> mature embryo.
- **Typical Dicot Embryo:** **Embryonal axis** and two **cotyledons**.
     - **Epicotyl:** Above cotyledons, terminates in **plumule** (stem tip).
     - **Hypocotyl:** Below cotyledons, terminates in **radicle** (root tip), covered by root cap.
- **Monocotyledonous Embryo:** Only one cotyledon (**scutellum**).
     - **Scutellum:** Lateral to embryonal axis.
     - **Coleorrhiza:** Undifferentiated sheath enclosing radicle and root cap.
     - **Coleoptile:** Hollow foliar structure enclosing shoot apex and leaf primordia above epicotyl.

#### Seed: Final product of sexual reproduction, a fertilised ovule.

- **Structure:** **Seed coat(s)**, cotyledon(s), embryo axis.
- **Food Reserves:** Cotyledons may be thick/swollen due to stored food.
- **Types:**
     - **Non-albuminous/Ex-albuminous:** No residual endosperm (e.g., pea, groundnut).
     - **Albuminous:** Retain part of endosperm (e.g., wheat, maize, castor).
- **Perisperm:** Remnants of nucellus in some seeds (e.g., black pepper, beet).
- **Seed Coat:** Hardened integuments, protective.
- **Micropyle:** Small pore for O2 and H2O entry during germination.
- **Dormancy:** Reduced water content, slowed metabolic activity, embryo enters inactivity state. Germinates under favorable conditions.
- **Viability:** Variable, from months to hundreds/thousands of years (e.g., _Lupinus arcticus_, _Phoenix dactylifera_).

#### Fruit: Developed from ovary after fertilisation.

- **Pericarp:** Wall of ovary develops into fruit wall.
- **Types:** Fleshy (guava, mango), dry (groundnut, mustard).
- **True Fruits:** Develop only from the ovary.
- **False Fruits:** Other floral parts (e.g., thalamus) also contribute (e.g., apple, strawberry, cashew).
- **Parthenocarpic Fruits:** Develop without fertilisation, typically seedless (e.g., banana). Can be induced by growth hormones.
- **Advantages of Seeds:** Independent of water for reproduction, better dispersal strategies, food reserves for seedling, hard seed coat for protection, genetic variations from sexual reproduction. Crucial for agriculture (storage).

### E. Apomixis and Polyembryony

#### Apomixis:

- **Definition:** A form of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction, producing seeds without fertilisation (e.g., some Asteraceae, grasses, _Citrus_, _Mango_).
- **Mechanism:** Diploid egg cell forms without reduction division and develops into embryo without fertilisation; or nucellar cells protrude into embryo sac and develop into embryos.
- **Genetic Nature:** Apomictic embryos are genetically identical to the parent (clones).
- **Importance:** Allows farmers to continuously use hybrid seeds without losing desired characters due to segregation, reducing cost. Active research to transfer apomictic genes into hybrids.

#### Polyembryony:

- **Definition:** Occurrence of more than one embryo in a seed (e.g., _Citrus_, _Mango_). Often results from apomixis.

## Answer Key for Quiz

1.    **Biology** is fundamentally the story of life on Earth, encompassing the processes that allow species to persist over millions of years despite individual death. **Reproduction** is vital because it ensures the continuity of species by producing new progeny, preventing extinction.
2.    The **tapetum** is the innermost wall layer of the microsporangium. Its primary function is to **nourish the developing pollen grains**, and its cells typically possess dense cytoplasm and more than one nucleus.
3.    **Sporopollenin** is one of the most resistant organic materials known, forming the hard outer layer (**exine**) of pollen grains. Its presence allows pollen grains to be well-preserved as fossils and withstand high temperatures, strong acids, and alkali, protecting the genetic material inside.
4.    A **2-celled pollen grain** contains a large vegetative cell with abundant food reserves and an irregular nucleus, and a smaller generative cell floating within it. A **3-celled pollen grain** results when the generative cell divides mitotically to form two male gametes before pollen shedding.
5.    **Monosporic development** refers to the formation of the female gametophyte (embryo sac) from a single functional megaspore, while the other three megaspores formed during meiosis degenerate. This is the most common method of embryo sac formation in flowering plants.
6.    The three parts of a pistil are the **stigma**, **style**, and **ovary**. The **stigma** serves as the receptive landing platform for pollen grains, facilitating their capture during pollination.
7.    **Autogamy** is self-pollination occurring within the same flower, where pollen transfers from anther to its own stigma. **Geitonogamy** is the transfer of pollen between different flowers on the same plant. Genetically, geitonogamy is similar to autogamy because the pollen grains come from the same plant, leading to progeny that are genetically identical to the parent.
8.    Wind-pollinated flowers often possess **well-exposed stamens**, allowing easy dispersal of pollen into wind currents. They also typically have **large, often feathery stigmas** to effectively trap airborne pollen grains.
9.    **Double fertilisation** is a unique event in flowering plants involving two fusion events. **Syngamy** is the fusion of one male gamete with the egg cell to form a diploid zygote. **Triple fusion** is the fusion of the other male gamete with the two polar nuclei in the central cell, forming a triploid primary endosperm nucleus (PEN).
10.   **Apomixis** is a special mechanism in some flowering plants that produces seeds without fertilisation, mimicking sexual reproduction. In hybrid crop cultivation, apomixis is advantageous because it ensures that hybrid characters are maintained in subsequent generations, allowing farmers to reuse hybrid seeds year after year without segregation of desirable traits.
