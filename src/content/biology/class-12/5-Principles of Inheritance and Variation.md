## Principles of Inheritance and Variation

### Introduction to Genetics

Genetics is the branch of biology that scientifically deals with **inheritance** and **variation** of characters from parents to offspring .

- **Inheritance**: The process by which characters (traits) are passed from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity .
- **Variation**: The degree by which progeny differ from their parents .
     - Early humans (8000-1000 B.C.) recognized sexual reproduction as a cause of variation and exploited it through artificial selection and domestication to breed desirable organisms (e.g., Sahiwal cows) [2, 3].

### Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance

**Gregor Mendel** conducted hybridisation experiments on garden peas from 1856-1863, proposing laws of inheritance .

- He was the first to apply **statistical analysis and mathematical logic** to biological problems .
- His experiments had a **large sampling size** and were confirmed across successive generations [4, 5].
- He investigated characters with **two opposing traits** (e.g., tall/dwarf, yellow/green seeds) .

#### Experimental Setup

- Mendel used **true-breeding pea lines**, which show stable trait inheritance through continuous self-pollination .
- He selected 14 true-breeding pea plant varieties, as pairs, differing in one character with contrasting traits .

**Table: Contrasting Traits Studied by Mendel in Pea** [7, 8]

| S.No. | Characters      | Contrasting Traits   |
| :---- | :-------------- | :------------------- |
| 1.    | Stem height     | Tall/dwarf           |
| 2.    | Flower colour   | Violet/white         |
| 3.    | Flower position | Axial/terminal       |
| 4.    | Pod shape       | Inflated/constricted |
| 5.    | Pod colour      | Green/yellow         |
| 6.    | Seed shape      | Round/wrinkled       |
| 7.    | Seed colour     | Yellow/green         |

### Inheritance of One Gene (Monohybrid Cross)

Mendel crossed tall and dwarf pea plants to study the inheritance of a single gene .

- **F1 Generation**: All progeny plants were tall, resembling one parent; the dwarf trait was not seen .
- **F2 Generation**: Upon self-pollination of F1 plants, dwarf offspring reappeared. The proportion was **1/4 dwarf and 3/4 tall** .
- The traits did not blend; offspring were either tall or dwarf .
- In F2, both parental traits were expressed in a **3:1 ratio** .

#### Concepts Introduced by Mendel

- **Factors (Genes)**: Stably passed down, unchanged from parent to offspring through gametes. Genes are units of inheritance containing information for a particular trait .
- **Alleles**: Genes that code for a pair of contrasting traits; slightly different forms of the same gene .
     - Capital letters for dominant traits (T for Tall), small letters for recessive traits (t for dwarf) .
- **Homozygous**: Allelic pair of genes are identical (e.g., TT, tt) .
- **Heterozygous**: Allelic pair of genes are dissimilar (e.g., Tt) .
- **Genotype**: The genetic composition of an organism (e.g., TT, Tt, tt) .
- **Phenotype**: The observable descriptive terms for a trait (e.g., tall, dwarf) .
- **Dominant Factor**: One factor in a dissimilar pair dominates the other and is expressed (e.g., T for tallness) [13, 15].
- **Recessive Factor**: The factor that is suppressed by the dominant factor and only expressed in the homozygous condition (e.g., t for dwarfness) [13, 15].
- **Monohybrid Cross**: A cross between parents heterozygous for genes controlling one character (e.g., Tt x Tt) .

#### Law of Segregation

- When tall and dwarf plants produce gametes via meiosis, alleles of the parental pair **separate or segregate** from each other, so each gamete receives only one allele [16, 17].
- This segregation is a **random process**, with a 50% chance for each allele .
- Homozygous parents produce similar gametes; heterozygous parents produce two kinds of gametes in equal proportion .

#### Punnett Square

- Developed by Reginald C. Punnett, it is a graphical representation to calculate the probability of all possible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross [18, 19].
- For a monohybrid cross (TT x tt), the F1 (Tt) self-pollinated yields F2 zygotes in genotypes: **1/4 TT, 1/2 Tt, 1/4 tt** .
- The phenotypic ratio in F2 for a monohybrid cross (e.g., Tall:Dwarf) is **3:1** .
- The genotypic ratio in F2 for a monohybrid cross is **1:2:1** .

#### Test Cross

- Used to determine the genotype of an organism showing a dominant phenotype .
- The organism is crossed with the **recessive parent** instead of self-crossing .
- The progeny analysis helps predict the test organism's genotype .

### Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance

1.    **Law of Dominance**:
      - Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors (genes) .
      - Factors occur in pairs .
      - In a dissimilar pair, one member (dominant) dominates the other (recessive) .
      - Explains the expression of only one parental character in F1 and both in F2, and the 3:1 ratio in F2 .
2.    **Law of Segregation**:
      - Alleles do not show blending; both characters are recovered in F2 .
      - During gamete formation, factors or alleles of a pair segregate from each other, so each gamete receives only one of the two factors .

### Deviations from Mendelian Principles

#### Incomplete Dominance

- F1 phenotype does not resemble either parent but is **in-between** them .
- **Example**: Flower colour in **dog flower (snapdragon)**. A cross between true-breeding red (RR) and white (rr) produces pink (Rr) F1 .
- F2 ratio: 1 Red (RR) : 2 Pink (Rr) : 1 White (rr). The genotypic ratio is 1:2:1, but the phenotypic ratio changes from 3:1 to **1:2:1** because the heterozygote (Rr) is distinguishable [26, 27].
- This occurs when the dominant allele is not completely dominant over the recessive allele .

#### Explanation of Dominance

- A gene contains information for a particular trait, often producing an enzyme for a substrate transformation .
- **Normal allele**: Produces normal/efficient enzyme .
- **Modified allele**: May produce a less efficient, non-functional, or no enzyme .
- If the modified allele produces a non-functional or no enzyme, the phenotype depends on the unmodified (functioning) allele, which is then considered **dominant** . The recessive trait results from the non-functional or absent enzyme .

#### Co-dominance

- F1 generation resembles **both parents** .
- **Example**: **ABO blood grouping in humans** .
     - Controlled by gene 'I' with three alleles: I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, and i .
     - I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> produce slightly different sugars on red blood cell surfaces .
     - Allele 'i' produces no sugar .
     - I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> are completely dominant over 'i' .
     - When I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> are present together, they both express their own types of sugars, resulting in **AB blood type** – this is co-dominance .
     - Humans, being diploid, possess any two of these three alleles .

**Table: Genetic Basis of ABO Blood Groups**

| Allele from Parent 1 | Allele from Parent 2 | Genotype of offspring      | Blood types of offspring |
| :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| I<sup>A</sup>        | I<sup>A</sup>        | I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup> | A                        |
| I<sup>A</sup>        | I<sup>B</sup>        | I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> | AB                       |
| I<sup>A</sup>        | i                    | I<sup>A</sup>i             | A                        |
| I<sup>B</sup>        | I<sup>A</sup>        | I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> | AB                       |
| I<sup>B</sup>        | I<sup>B</sup>        | I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup> | B                        |
| I<sup>B</sup>        | i                    | I<sup>B</sup>i             | B                        |
| i                    | i                    | ii                         | O                        |

- ABO blood grouping is also an example of **multiple alleles** (more than two alleles governing the same character in a population) .

#### Pleiotropy

- A **single gene** can exhibit **multiple phenotypic expressions** .
- The underlying mechanism is often the gene's effect on metabolic pathways .
- **Example 1: Phenylketonuria** in humans. Caused by a single gene mutation for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to mental retardation and reduced hair/skin pigmentation .
- **Example 2: Starch synthesis in pea seeds**. Controlled by one gene with two alleles (B and b) .
     - BB homozygotes: produce large starch grains, round seeds .
     - bb homozygotes: lesser efficiency, smaller starch grains, wrinkled seeds .
     - Bb heterozygotes: round seeds (B is dominant for seed shape), but intermediate size starch grains (incomplete dominance for starch grain size) [35, 37].
- Dominance is not an autonomous feature; it depends on the gene product and the chosen phenotype to examine [37, 38].

### Inheritance of Two Genes (Dihybrid Cross)

Mendel crossed pea plants differing in two characters, e.g., yellow and round seeds with green and wrinkled seeds .

- **F1 Generation**: All seeds were yellow and round, indicating **yellow colour is dominant over green**, and **round shape is dominant over wrinkled** .
- **F2 Generation**: Self-hybridising F1 (RrYy) plants produced a phenotypic ratio of **9:3:3:1** [40, 41].
     - 9 Round, Yellow
     - 3 Wrinkled, Yellow
     - 3 Round, Green
     - 1 Wrinkled, Green

#### Law of Independent Assortment

- When two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, the **segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters** .
- This means alleles for different traits assort independently during gamete formation [43, 44].
- For RrYy, the four types of gametes (RY, Ry, rY, ry) are produced each with a frequency of 25% (1/4th) .

### Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance

Mendel's work remained unrecognised until 1900 due to:

1.    Poor communication .
2.    Unaccepted concept of discrete, non-blending 'factors' in the face of continuous variation .
3.    Novel use of mathematics in biology, which was unacceptable to many biologists .
4.    No physical proof for 'factors' .

- In 1900, de Vries, Correns, and von Tschermak independently rediscovered Mendel's results .
- Advancements in microscopy led to the discovery of **chromosomes** (colored bodies) that double and divide during cell division [46, 47].
- By 1902, **Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri** noted that the behavior of chromosomes was **parallel to the behavior of genes**, using chromosome movement to explain Mendel’s laws .
     - They argued that pairing and separation of chromosomes lead to the segregation of factors they carry .
- **Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance**: Sutton united knowledge of chromosomal segregation with Mendelian principles .
- **Key points of parallelism**:
     - Chromosomes and genes occur in pairs [49, 50].
     - They segregate during gamete formation, with only one of each pair transmitted to a gamete [49, 50].
     - Independent pairs segregate independently of each other .
     - The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous sites on homologous chromosomes .
     - During Anaphase I of meiosis, chromosome pairs align independently at the metaphase plate .

### Linkage and Recombination

- **Thomas Hunt Morgan** experimentally verified the chromosomal theory using the fruit fly, **_Drosophila melanogaster_** .
     - _Drosophila_ advantages: simple synthetic medium, 2-week life cycle, large progeny, clear sex differentiation, observable hereditary variations [52, 53].
- Morgan's dihybrid crosses in _Drosophila_ (e.g., yellow-bodied, white-eyed females x brown-bodied, red-eyed males) showed that genes did not always segregate independently, and F2 ratios deviated significantly from 9:3:3:1 [53, 54].
- This deviation occurred when two genes were situated on the **same chromosome** .
     - **Linkage**: The physical association of genes on a chromosome . When genes are linked, parental gene combinations are much higher than non-parental types .
     - **Recombination**: The generation of non-parental gene combinations .
- Some genes are **tightly linked** (low recombination, e.g., white and yellow showed 1.3%) .
- Other genes are **loosely linked** (higher recombination, e.g., white and miniature wing showed 37.2%) .
- Morgan's student, **Alfred Sturtevant**, used the **frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes** to 'map' their position on the chromosome .
- Genetic maps are now extensively used in whole genome sequencing .

### Polygenic Inheritance

- Traits controlled by **three or more genes** [57, 58].
- Show a **gradient** of occurrence rather than distinct alternatives (e.g., human height, skin colour) [57, 58].
- Involves **multiple genes** and is influenced by the **environment** .
- The phenotype reflects the **additive contribution of each allele** .
- **Example: Human skin colour**. Assumed to be controlled by three genes (A, B, C).
     - Dominant alleles (A, B, C) for dark skin; recessive alleles (a, b, c) for light skin .
     - AABBCC genotype: darkest skin colour .
     - aabbcc genotype: lightest skin colour .
     - Genotypes with intermediate numbers of dominant and recessive alleles have intermediate skin colour .

### Sex Determination

- Early clues came from insect studies .
- **Henking (1891)** observed a specific nuclear structure, the **X body**, in 50% of sperm in some insects; later identified as the **X-chromosome** [60, 61].

#### Types of Sex Determination Mechanisms

1.    **XO Type**:
      - Found in a large number of insects (e.g., **grasshopper**) [61, 62].
      - Females have two X chromosomes (XX); males have one X chromosome (XO) .
      - Eggs bear an X-chromosome; some sperm bear X, some do not [61, 62].
      - Sperm with X fertilise to form females; sperm without X fertilise to form males .
      - Males have half the number of X chromosomes compared to females .
2.    **XY Type**:
      - Found in many insects and **mammals, including humans and _Drosophila_** [63, 64].
      - Males have an X and a distinctly smaller Y chromosome (XY); females have a pair of X chromosomes (XX) [63, 64].
      - Both males and females have the same number of autosomes .
3.    **ZW Type (Female Heterogamety)**:
      - Found in organisms like **birds** .
      - Total chromosome number is the same in males and females .
      - Females produce two different types of gametes based on sex chromosomes (Z and W); males produce one type (ZZ) [65, 66].
      - Females are ZW; males are ZZ .

#### Sex Determination in Humans

- **XY type** .
- Humans have **23 pairs of chromosomes**: 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes .
- Females: 22 autosome pairs + XX .
- Males: 22 autosome pairs + XY .
- During spermatogenesis, males produce two types of sperm: 50% carry X-chromosome, 50% carry Y-chromosome .
- Females produce only one type of ovum: carrying an X-chromosome .
- **Sperm determines the sex of the child**:
     - Ovum (X) + Sperm (X) = Female (XX) .
     - Ovum (X) + Sperm (Y) = Male (XY) .
- There is a 50% probability of either a male or female child in each pregnancy .

#### Sex Determination in Honey Bee

- Based on the **number of sets of chromosomes** an individual receives (haplodiploid system) [69, 70].
- **Females (Queen or Worker)**: Develop from **fertilised eggs** (union of sperm and egg); they are **diploid** (32 chromosomes) [69, 70].
- **Males (Drone)**: Develop from **unfertilised eggs** via parthenogenesis; they are **haploid** (16 chromosomes) [69, 70].
- Unique characteristics of males:
     - Produce sperm by mitosis .
     - Do not have a father .
     - Cannot have sons .
     - Have a grandfather .
     - Can have grandsons .

### Mutation

- A phenomenon resulting in **alteration of DNA sequences**, leading to changes in genotype and phenotype .
- Along with recombination, it is a source of DNA variation .
- **Chromosomal aberrations**: Loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a DNA segment, resulting in altered chromosomes. Commonly observed in cancer cells .
- **Point mutation**: Change in a single base pair of DNA .
     - **Classical example**: **Sickle cell anaemia** .
- **Frame-shift mutations**: Caused by deletions and insertions of base pairs .
- **Mutagens**: Chemical and physical factors that induce mutations (e.g., UV radiations) .

### Genetic Disorders

Broadly classified into Mendelian disorders and Chromosomal disorders .

#### Pedigree Analysis

- The study of family history about inheritance of a particular trait over several generations .
- Provides a tool to trace the inheritance of specific traits, abnormalities, or diseases in human genetics .

#### Mendelian Disorders

- Mainly determined by **alteration or mutation in a single gene** .
- Their inheritance pattern can be traced by pedigree analysis .
- May be **dominant or recessive**, and can be **linked to sex chromosomes** (e.g., X-linked recessive) .
- **Examples**: Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-cell anaemia, Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia .

1.    **Colour Blindness**:

      - **Sex-linked recessive disorder** .
      - Defect in red or green cones of the eye, causing failure to discriminate between red and green colour .
      - Due to mutation in genes on the **X chromosome** .
      - Occurs in about 8% of males and 0.4% of females .
      - Males have only one X chromosome, so they express the trait if they inherit the recessive gene .
      - Females are usually carriers if heterozygous (their normal dominant gene suppresses the recessive one) .

2.    **Haemophilia**:

      - **Sex-linked recessive disease** .
      - Transmission from unaffected carrier female to some male progeny .
      - Affects a single protein involved in blood clotting cascade, leading to non-stop bleeding from simple cuts .
      - Heterozygous females are carriers .
      - A female becoming haemophilic is extremely rare (mother must be a carrier, father haemophilic) .
      - **Queen Victoria's family pedigree** shows haemophilic descendants .

3.    **Sickle-cell Anaemia**:

      - **Autosome-linked recessive trait** .
      - Transmitted when both parents are carriers (heterozygous) .
      - Controlled by a single pair of alleles: Hb<sup>A</sup> and Hb<sup>S</sup> .
      - Homozygous individuals for Hb<sup>S</sup> (Hb<sup>S</sup>Hb<sup>S</sup>) show the diseased phenotype .
      - Heterozygous (Hb<sup>A</sup>Hb<sup>S</sup>) individuals are apparently unaffected but are carriers (50% chance of transmitting mutant gene) .
      - **Defect**: Substitution of **Glutamic acid (Glu) by Valine (Val)** at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the haemoglobin molecule .
      - This is due to a **single base substitution** at the sixth codon of the beta globin gene from **GAG to GUG** .
      - Mutant haemoglobin polymerises under low oxygen tension, changing RBC shape from biconcave disc to elongated sickle-like .

4.    **Phenylketonuria**:

      - **Autosomal recessive trait** and an inborn error of metabolism .
      - Affected individuals lack an enzyme that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine .
      - Phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylpyruvic acid and other derivatives .
      - Accumulation in the brain leads to **mental retardation** .
      - Excreted through urine due to poor kidney absorption .

5.    **Thalassemia**:
      - **Autosome-linked recessive blood disease** .
      - Transmitted when both parents are unaffected carriers .
      - Caused by mutation or deletion, leading to **reduced rate of synthesis of one of the globin chains** (alpha or beta) that make up haemoglobin .
      - Results in abnormal haemoglobin molecules and **anaemia** .
      - **α Thalassemia**: Affects α globin chain production; controlled by two linked genes (HBA1, HBA2) on chromosome 16. More affected genes mean less alpha globin .
      - **β Thalassemia**: Affects β globin chain production; controlled by a single gene (HBB) on chromosome 11. Occurs due to mutation of one or both genes .
      - **Difference from sickle-cell anaemia**: Thalassemia is a **quantitative problem** (too few globin molecules), while sickle-cell anaemia is a **qualitative problem** (incorrectly functioning globin) .

#### Chromosomal Disorders

- Caused by the **absence, excess, or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes** .
- **Aneuploidy**: Gain or loss of a chromosome(s) due to failure of chromatid segregation during cell division .
     - **Trisomy**: Gain of an extra copy of a chromosome (e.g., trisomy of chromosome 21 in Down's syndrome) [84, 85].
     - **Monosomy**: Loss of one of any one pair of chromosomes (e.g., loss of an X chromosome in Turner's syndrome) [84, 85].
- **Polyploidy**: Increase in a whole set of chromosomes, often seen in plants, due to failure of cytokinesis after telophase .
- Normal human cells have **46 chromosomes (23 pairs)**: 22 autosome pairs + 1 sex chromosome pair .

1.    **Down’s Syndrome**:

      - Caused by the presence of an **additional copy of chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21)** .
      - First described by Langdon Down (1866) .
      - **Symptoms**: Short stature, small round head, furrowed tongue, partially open mouth, broad palm with characteristic palm crease, retarded physical, psychomotor, and mental development .

2.    **Klinefelter’s Syndrome**:

      - Caused by the presence of an **additional X-chromosome**, resulting in a karyotype of **47, XXY** .
      - **Symptoms**: Overall masculine development with expression of feminine development (e.g., development of breasts, **Gynaecomastia**), individuals are **sterile** .

3.    **Turner’s Syndrome**:
      - Caused by the **absence of one of the X chromosomes**, resulting in a karyotype of **45, X0** .
      - **Symptoms**: Females are **sterile** (rudimentary ovaries), lack other secondary sexual characters, short stature .
