## Origin of Life

- **Evolutionary Biology** is the study of the history of life forms on Earth.
- The **universe** is approximately 13.8 billion years old, comprised of huge clusters of galaxies, stars, and clouds of gas and dust. The Earth is a tiny speck within this vast universe.
- The **Big Bang theory** explains the origin of the universe as a singular, huge explosion followed by expansion and cooling, leading to the formation of Hydrogen and Helium, which then condensed into galaxies.
- **Earth's Formation:** Approximately 4.5 billion years ago, within the solar system of the Milky Way galaxy.
     - Early Earth had no atmosphere.
     - Water vapour, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia were released from molten mass.
     - UV rays from the sun broke water into Hydrogen (which escaped) and Oxygen.
     - Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water, CO2, and other compounds.
     - The **ozone layer** was formed.
     - As it cooled, water vapour fell as rain, filling depressions to form oceans.
- **Appearance of Life:** Life appeared about 500 million years after Earth's formation, roughly 4 billion years ago.

### Theories on the Origin of Life

- **Panspermia:** Early Greek thinkers believed units of life, called spores, were transferred to different planets, including Earth. This idea is still favored by some astronomers.
- **Theory of Spontaneous Generation:** Believed life arose from decaying and rotting matter (e.g., straw, mud).
     - **Louis Pasteur** disproved this theory through careful experimentation, showing that life only comes from pre-existing life. In sterilised flasks, no life arose from killed yeast, unlike in flasks open to air.
- **Oparin and Haldane's Hypothesis (Chemical Evolution):**
     - Proposed that the first life form originated from pre-existing non-living organic molecules (like RNA, protein).
     - Life's formation was preceded by **chemical evolution**, the formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic constituents.
     - Early Earth conditions: High temperature, volcanic storms, and a reducing atmosphere containing CH4 and NH3.
     - **S.L. Miller's Experiment (1953):** Replicated early Earth conditions in a laboratory, creating electric discharge in a closed flask with CH4, H2, NH3, and water vapour at 800Â°C.
          - He observed the formation of **amino acids**.
          - Similar experiments by others led to the formation of sugars, nitrogen bases, pigments, and fats.
          - Analysis of meteorite content also revealed similar compounds, suggesting similar processes elsewhere in space.
     - This evidence led to the acceptance of **chemical evolution** as the first part of the conjectured story of life's origin.

### Early Forms of Life

- The first **non-cellular forms of life** may have originated 3 billion years ago. They were likely giant molecules (RNA, Protein, Polysaccharides) that reproduced their molecules.
- The first **cellular forms of life** probably originated around 2000 million years ago, likely as single-cells in a water environment.
- The concept of **abiogenesis**, where the first life form slowly arose through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules, is widely accepted.

## Evolution of Life Forms - A Theory

### Theory of Special Creation

Conventional religious literature proposes:

- All living organisms (species) were created as they are today.
- Diversity has always been and will remain the same.
- The Earth is about 4000 years old.
- These ideas were strongly challenged in the nineteenth century.

### Charles Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection

- Based on observations during his sea voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle.
- **Key Conclusions:**
     - Existing life forms share varying degrees of similarities with each other and with life forms from millions of years ago.
     - Many past life forms are now extinct; new forms have arisen at different times.
     - There has been a **gradual evolution of life forms**.
- **Natural Selection (Mechanism of Evolution):**
     - Every population has built-in variations in characteristics.
     - Individuals with traits that enable them to **survive better** in natural conditions (climate, food, physical factors) will outbreed others.
     - **Fitness** refers ultimately to **reproductive fitness**.
     - Those better fit in an environment leave more progeny, survive more, and are thus **selected by nature**.
     - **Alfred Wallace** independently reached similar conclusions around the same time.
- **Common Ancestry:** All existing life forms share common ancestors, which were present at different geological periods.
- **Earth's Age:** The geological history closely correlates with biological history, concluding that Earth is billions of years old, not thousands.

## What are the Evidences for Evolution?

### 1. Paleontological Evidence (Fossils)

- **Fossils** are the remains of hard parts of life-forms found in rocks.
- Rocks form sediments, and different-aged sedimentary layers contain fossils of different life-forms that died during the sediment's formation.
- Some fossils resemble modern organisms, while others represent extinct organisms (e.g., Dinosaurs).
- Studying fossils in sedimentary layers shows that life-forms varied over time, and certain forms were restricted to specific geological time-spans, indicating new life forms arose at different times.
- Fossil ages can be calculated using **radioactive-dating**.

### 2. Embryological Support (Disproved)

- **Ernst Heckel** proposed embryological support based on common embryonic features in vertebrates (e.g., vestigial gill slits behind the head in all vertebrate embryos, functional only in adult fish).
- However, **Karl Ernst von Baer** disproved this, noting that embryos never pass through the adult stages of other animals.

### 3. Comparative Anatomy and Morphology

- Compares similarities and differences among living organisms and extinct ones to understand shared ancestry.

#### Homologous Organs (Divergent Evolution)

- **Definition:** Structures with similar anatomical structure but performing different functions due to adaptations to different needs.
- **Indicates Common Ancestry**.
- **Examples:**
     - Forelimbs of whales, bats, cheetah, and humans (all mammals) have similar bone patterns: humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges.
     - Vertebrate hearts or brains.
     - Thorn of Bougainvillea and tendril of Cucurbita (plants).

#### Analogous Organs (Convergent Evolution)

- **Definition:** Structures that look alike and perform similar functions but are not anatomically similar.
- Result from similar habitats leading to the selection of similar adaptive features in different groups of organisms towards the same function.
- **Examples:**
     - Wings of a butterfly and a bird.
     - Eye of an octopus and a mammal.
     - Flippers of Penguins and Dolphins.
     - Sweet potato (root modification) and potato (stem modification).

### 4. Biochemical Similarities

- Similarities in proteins and genes performing a given function among diverse organisms provide clues to **common ancestry**, paralleling structural similarities.

### 5. Artificial Selection (Anthropogenic Action)

- Humans have selectively bred plants and animals for agriculture, horticulture, sport, or security, creating diverse breeds (e.g., dogs) from the same group.
- This demonstrates that if humans can create new breeds in hundreds of years, nature could achieve similar changes over millions of years.

### 6. Industrial Melanism (Natural Selection in Moths)

- **Observation in England (Biston betularia moths):**
     - **1850s (before industrialization):** More white-winged moths were observed on trees than dark-winged (melanised) moths.
          - Trees were covered with white-coloured lichens, providing camouflage for white moths. Dark moths were spotted by predators.
     - **1920 (after industrialization):** The proportion reversed; more dark-winged moths were found in the same area.
          - Tree trunks became dark due to industrial smoke and soot, camouflaging dark moths, while white moths were easily spotted by predators.
- **Explanation:** Predators spot moths against contrasting backgrounds. Lichens indicate unpolluted areas. Moths that could camouflage themselves survived.
- In rural, unpolluted areas, the count of melanic moths remained low.
- This illustrates that in a mixed population, those better-adapted survive and increase their population size, though no variant is completely wiped out.

### 7. Resistance to Herbicides, Pesticides, and Antibiotics

- Excessive use of herbicides, pesticides, antibiotics, or drugs leads to the selection of resistant varieties/organisms/cells in a much shorter time scale (months or years).
- These are examples of evolution by **anthropogenic action**.
- Evolution is a **stochastic process** based on chance events in nature and chance mutations, not a directed process.

## What is Adaptive Radiation?

- **Definition:** The process of evolution of different species in a given geographical area, starting from a point, and literally radiating to other areas of geography (habitats).
- **Examples:**
     - **Darwin's Finches (Galapagos Islands):** Darwin observed diverse small black birds. He conjectured that many varieties evolved on the island from an original seed-eating form, with altered beaks enabling them to become insectivorous and vegetarian finches.
     - **Australian Marsupials:** A number of different marsupials evolved from an ancestral stock, all within the Australian island continent.
- **Convergent Evolution:** When more than one adaptive radiation occurs in an isolated geographical area (representing different habitats), leading to "similar" forms.
     - **Example:** Placental mammals in Australia also exhibit adaptive radiation, with each variety appearing similar to a corresponding marsupial (e.g., Placental wolf and Tasmanian wolf-marsupial).

## Biological Evolution

- True evolution by natural selection began when cellular forms of life with metabolic differences originated on Earth.
- **Essence of Darwinian theory:** Natural selection.
- **Rate of Evolution:** Linked to the life cycle or life span.
     - **Microbes** (fast-dividing) can evolve new species within days due to selective pressure from changing conditions.
     - For animals like fish or fowl, this takes millions of years.
- **Fitness:** Refers to an individual's ability to survive better under new conditions. It is based on **inherited characteristics** and has a **genetic basis**.
- **Key Concepts of Darwinian Theory:** **Branching descent** and **natural selection**.
- **Lamarck's Theory:** Proposed evolution driven by the use and disuse of organs (e.g., giraffes developing long necks by stretching). This conjecture is no longer believed.
- **Evolution as Process or Result:** The world we see is a success story of evolution.
     - Describing the story of the world: Evolution is a **process**.
     - Describing the story of life on Earth: Evolution is a **consequence** of natural selection.
     - The distinction between evolution and natural selection as processes or end results remains unclear.
- **Influences on Darwin:** Thomas Malthus's work on populations.
- **Factual Observations Underlying Natural Selection:**
     - Natural resources are limited.
     - Populations are generally stable in size (except seasonal fluctuations).
     - Members of a population vary in characteristics (no two individuals are alike), and most variations are inherited.
     - Theoretical exponential population growth versus real-world limited sizes implies competition for resources, meaning only some survive and flourish.
- **Darwin's Insight:** Heritable variations that improve resource utilization enable individuals to reproduce and leave more progeny. Over many generations, this leads to changes in population characteristics and the appearance of new forms.

## Mechanism of Evolution

- **Origin of Variation:**
     - Darwin observed inheritable 'factors' influencing phenotype but remained silent on their origin.
     - **Hugo deVries** (early 20th century), based on his work on evening primrose, introduced the idea of **mutations** â large differences arising suddenly in a population.
     - DeVries believed mutations cause evolution, not minor variations. He described mutations as **random and directionless**.
     - He called mutation-caused speciation **saltation** (single step large mutation).
     - In contrast, Darwinian variations were considered small and directional, leading to gradual evolution.
- Studies in **population genetics** later clarified these concepts.

## Hardy-Weinberg Principle

- **Core Principle:** In a given population, the frequency of alleles of a gene or locus remains fixed and constant from generation to generation.
- **Genetic Equilibrium:** The gene pool (total genes and their alleles in a population) remains constant. The sum total of all allelic frequencies is 1.
- **Algebraic Equation:** For a gene with two alleles, A and a, with frequencies p and q respectively in a diploid population:
     - Frequency of AA individuals = pÂ².
     - Frequency of aa individuals = qÂ².
     - Frequency of Aa individuals = 2pq.
     - Therefore, **pÂ² + 2pq + qÂ² = 1** (This is the binomial expansion of (p+q)Â²).
- **Evolutionary Change:** When measured frequencies differ from expected values, it indicates the extent and direction of evolutionary change. A disturbance in genetic equilibrium (change in allele frequency) is interpreted as evolution.

### Factors Affecting Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (and causing Evolution)

1.    **Gene Migration or Gene Flow:** Movement of a section of a population to another place changes gene frequencies in both the original and new populations (new genes/alleles are added to the new population and lost from the old).
2.    **Genetic Drift:** A chance change in allele frequency.
      - **Founder Effect:** When the change in allele frequency is so significant in a new population sample that it becomes a different species; the original drifted population becomes the "founders".
3.    **Mutation:** Leads to new phenotypes when pre-existing advantageous mutations are selected, resulting in speciation over generations.
4.    **Genetic Recombination:** During gametogenesis, leads to variation.
5.    **Natural Selection:** A process where heritable variations enabling better survival lead to increased reproductive success and more progeny.
      - Variations (from mutation, recombination, gene flow, or genetic drift) change gene/allele frequencies in future generations.
      - Natural selection can lead to different outcomes in population characteristics (Figure 6.8):
           - **Stabilisation:** More individuals acquire the mean character value.
           - **Directional Change:** More individuals acquire a value other than the mean character value.
           - **Disruption:** More individuals acquire peripheral character values at both ends of the distribution curve.

## A Brief Account of Evolution

- **2000 mya:** First cellular forms of life appeared. The mechanism of evolution from non-cellular aggregates to cells with membranes is unknown.
- Some early cells developed the ability to release O2, possibly through reactions similar to photosynthesis.
- **500 mya:** Single-celled organisms evolved into multicellular life forms. Invertebrates were formed and active.
- **350 mya:** Jawless fish probably evolved. Fish with stout fins could move on land and return to water.
- **320 mya:** Sea weeds and a few plants existed. Plants were the first organisms to invade land and were widespread when animals moved onto land.
- **Fish to Amphibians:**
     - In 1938, a **Coelacanth** fish (thought extinct) was caught in South Africa.
     - **Lobefins** evolved into the first **amphibians** (lived on both land and water). These were ancestors of modern frogs and salamanders.
- **Amphibians to Reptiles:**
     - Amphibians evolved into **reptiles**, which lay thick-shelled eggs that don't dry up (unlike amphibian eggs).
     - Modern descendants include turtles, tortoises, and crocodiles.
- **Dominance of Reptiles:** For about 200 million years, reptiles of various shapes and sizes dominated Earth.
     - Giant ferns (pteridophytes) formed coal deposits.
     - Some land reptiles returned to water and evolved into fish-like reptiles (e.g., Ichthyosaurs) around 200 mya.
     - Land reptiles included **dinosaurs**, such as the Tyrannosaurus rex (20 feet tall, fearsome teeth).
     - **65 mya:** Dinosaurs suddenly disappeared from Earth. Possible reasons include climatic changes or evolution into birds. Small reptiles from that era still exist.
- **Mammals:**
     - The first mammals were small, like shrews.
     - They were **viviparous** (protected unborn young inside the mother's body) and more intelligent in sensing and avoiding danger.
     - Mammals took over after reptiles declined.
     - **Continental Drift's Impact:**
          - When South America joined North America, native South American mammals (resembling horse, hippopotamus, bear, rabbit) were overridden by North American fauna.
          - Pouched mammals of Australia survived due to isolation and lack of competition.
     - Some mammals adapted to living wholly in water (e.g., whales, dolphins, seals, sea cows).
     - The evolution of man, with language skills and self-consciousness, is considered the most successful story.

## Origin and Evolution of Man

- **15 mya:** Primates like **Dryopithecus** (more ape-like) and **Ramapithecus** (more man-like) existed. They were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees.
- **3-4 mya:** Man-like primates with hominid features walked upright in eastern Africa (fossils found in Ethiopia and Tanzania), probably not taller than 4 feet.
- **2 mya:** **Australopithecines** lived in East African grasslands. They hunted with stone weapons but primarily ate fruit.
- **Homo habilis:** The first human-like being, with brain capacities between 650-800 cc. They probably did not eat meat.
- **Homo erectus (~1.5 mya):** Fossils found in Java (1891). Had a larger brain (around 900 cc) and probably ate meat.
- **Neanderthal man (~100,000-40,000 years back):** Lived in the Near East and Central Asia. Brain size was 1400 cc. They used hides for protection and buried their dead.
- **Homo sapiens:**
     - Arose in Africa and then migrated across continents, developing into distinct races.
     - Modern Homo sapiens appeared during the ice age (between 75,000-10,000 years ago).
     - Pre-historic cave art developed around 18,000 years ago (e.g., Bhimbetka rock shelter in Madhya Pradesh).
     - Agriculture began around 10,000 years ago, leading to human settlements.
