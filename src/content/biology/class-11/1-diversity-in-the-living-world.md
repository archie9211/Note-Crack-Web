## Chapter 1: The Living World

### 1.1 Diversity in the Living World

- **Biology** is the science of life forms and living processes.
- Early humans easily distinguished between inanimate matter and living organisms and sometimes deified them due to awe or fear.
- **Anthropocentric views** limited early biological knowledge.
- **Systematic description of life forms** led to identification, nomenclature, and classification systems.
- A key revelation was the **sharing of similarities among living organisms**, indicating that all present-day organisms are related to each other and to all organisms that ever lived, which fostered conservation movements.
- The living world exhibits an amazing diversity of living types, found in extraordinary habitats from cold mountains to hot springs. The beauty and interactions of life evoke wonder and reflection on "what indeed is life?".
- The question "what is life?" has two implicit parts:
     - **Technical**: What is living as opposed to non-living?
     - **Philosophical**: What is the purpose of life? (Scientists focus on the technical question).
- **Diversity**: A large variety of living organisms are visible (potted plants, insects, birds, pets) and invisible (microbes). Increasing the area of observation increases the range and variety of organisms.
- Each different kind of plant, animal, or organism represents a **species**.
- The number of known and described species ranges between **1.7-1.8 million**, which refers to **biodiversity** (number and types of organisms). New organisms are continuously being identified in new and old areas.

### 1.2 Taxonomic Categories

- **Nomenclature**: The process of standardising the naming of living organisms so a particular organism is known by the same name worldwide.
     - Naming is only possible when the organism is correctly described and identified. This process is **identification**.
- **Scientific names** are based on agreed principles and criteria established by scientists and are acceptable to biologists globally.
     - For plants: **International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN)**.
     - For animals: **International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN)**.
     - Scientific names ensure each organism has **only one name** and that this name has not been used for any other known organism.
- **Binomial Nomenclature**: A system of providing a name with two components.
     - Given by **Carolus Linnaeus**.
     - Components: **Generic name** and **specific epithet**.
     - Example: For mango, **_Mangifera indica_**. _Mangifera_ is the genus, and _indica_ is the specific epithet.
- **Universal Rules of Nomenclature**:
     1.    **Biological names are generally in Latin** and written in _italics_, or Latinised/derived from Latin.
     2.    The **first word represents the genus**, and the **second component denotes the specific epithet**.
     3.    Both words, when handwritten, are **separately underlined**, or printed in _italics_, to indicate their Latin origin.
     4.    The **genus starts with a capital letter**; the **specific epithet starts with a small letter** (e.g., _Mangifera indica_).
     5.    The **author's name appears after the specific epithet** in abbreviated form (e.g., _Mangifera indica Linn._ indicating Linnaeus described it).
- **Classification**: The process of grouping anything into convenient categories based on easily observable characters.
     - Example: Recognising groups like plants, animals, dogs, cats, or insects.
     - **Taxa** (singular: taxon): The scientific term for these convenient categories used to study organisms. Taxa can indicate categories at very different levels (e.g., 'Plants' is a taxon, 'Wheat' is a taxon; 'animals', 'mammals', 'dogs' are all taxa at different levels).
- **Taxonomy**: The process of classifying living organisms based on characteristics.
     - Basis of modern taxonomic studies: **External and internal structure, cell structure, development process, and ecological information**.
     - **Basic processes of taxonomy**: Characterisation, identification, classification, and nomenclature.
     - Not new: Early classifications were based on the 'uses' of various organisms (food, clothing, shelter).
- **Systematics**: The branch of study interested in knowing different kinds of organisms, their diversities, and their relationships.
     - Derived from the Latin word 'systema' meaning systematic arrangement of organisms.
     - Linnaeus used **_Systema Naturae_** as the title of his publication.
     - The scope of systematics was later enlarged to include identification, nomenclature, and classification, and it now **takes into account evolutionary relationships** between organisms.

### 1.3 Taxonomic Hierarchy

- Classification is a hierarchy of steps, where each step represents a rank or category.
- A **taxonomic category** is part of the overall taxonomic arrangement.
- All categories together constitute the **taxonomic hierarchy**.
- Each category is a unit of classification, commonly termed a **taxon** (plural: taxa).
- **Common Taxonomic Categories** (in descending order):
     - **Kingdom**
     - **Phylum** (for animals) or **Division** (for plants)
     - **Class**
     - **Order**
     - **Family**
     - **Genus**
     - **Species**
- **Basis of arrangement**: As one moves from species to kingdom (ascending order), the number of common characteristics **decreases**.
     - **Lower the taxa**: More characteristics are shared among members within that taxon.
     - **Higher the category**: Greater difficulty in determining relationships to other taxa at the same level, making classification more complex.

#### 1.2.1 Species

- A group of individual organisms with **fundamental similarities**.
- Distinguishable from closely related species based on **distinct morphological differences**.
- Examples:
     - _Mangifera indica_ (mango): _indica_ is the specific epithet.
     - _Solanum tuberosum_ (potato): _tuberosum_ is the specific epithet.
     - _Panthera leo_ (lion): _leo_ is the specific epithet.
     - Human beings: _Homo sapiens_ (_sapiens_ is the specific epithet).

#### 1.2.2 Genus

- Comprises a group of **related species** that have more characters in common compared to species of other genera.
- Aggregates of closely related species.
- Examples:
     - Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) and brinjal (Solanum melongena) both belong to genus _Solanum_.
     - Lion (_Panthera leo_), leopard (_Panthera pardus_), and tiger (_Panthera tigris_) are species of the genus _Panthera_.
     - Genus _Panthera_ differs from genus _Felis_ (which includes cats).

#### 1.2.3 Family

- The next category, grouping **related genera**.
- Has fewer similarities compared to genus and species.
- Characterised by **both vegetative and reproductive features**.
- Examples:
     - Plant genera _Solanum_, _Petunia_, and _Datura_ are placed in the family **Solanaceae**.
     - Animal genera _Panthera_ (lion, tiger, leopard) and _Felis_ (cats) are placed in the family **Felidae**.
     - Cats (Felidae) and dogs (Canidae) are separated into two different families due to similarities and differences.

#### 1.2.4 Order

- Identified based on **aggregates of characters**.
- A higher category, it is an **assemblage of families** which exhibit a few similar characters. The similar characters are less in number compared to different genera within a family.
- Examples:
     - Plant families like Convolvulaceae and Solanaceae are included in the order **Polymoniales**, mainly based on floral characters.
     - The animal order **Carnivora** includes families like Felidae and Canidae.

#### 1.2.5 Class

- This category includes **related orders**.
- Example: Order Primata (monkey, gorilla, gibbon) is placed in class **Mammalia** along with order Carnivora (tiger, cat, dog).

#### 1.2.6 Phylum / Division

- **Phylum**: For animals, classes with common features like the presence of notochord and dorsal hollow neural system are grouped into a higher category called Phylum.
     - Example: Fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are included in phylum **Chordata**.
- **Division**: For plants, classes with a few similar characters are assigned to a higher category called Division.

#### 1.2.7 Kingdom

- The **highest category**.
- **Kingdom Animalia**: All animals belonging to various phyla.
- **Kingdom Plantae**: Comprises all plants from various divisions.

**Table 1.1: Organisms with their Taxonomic Categories**

| Common Name | Biological Name     | Genus       | Family        | Order      | Class           | Phylum/Division |
| :---------- | :------------------ | :---------- | :------------ | :--------- | :-------------- | :-------------- |
| Man         | _Homo sapiens_      | _Homo_      | Hominidae     | Primata    | Mammalia        | Chordata        |
| Housefly    | _Musca domestica_   | _Musca_     | Muscidae      | Diptera    | Insecta         | Arthropoda      |
| Mango       | _Mangifera indica_  | _Mangifera_ | Anacardiaceae | Sapindales | Dicotyledonae   | Angiospermae    |
| Wheat       | _Triticum aestivum_ | _Triticum_  | Poaceae       | Poales     | Monocotyledonae | Angiospermae    |

## Chapter 2: Biological Classification

### Historical Context and Whittaker's System

- Early attempts to classify organisms were instinctive and based on utility (food, shelter, clothing).
- **Aristotle**: Earliest to attempt a more scientific basis, using simple morphological characters.
     - Classified plants into trees, shrubs, and herbs.
     - Divided animals into two groups: those with red blood and those without.
- **Linnaeus' Two Kingdom System**: Developed with Plantae and Animalia kingdoms, including all plants and animals respectively.
     - **Limitations**:
          - Did not distinguish between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
          - Did not distinguish between unicellular and multicellular organisms.
          - Did not distinguish between photosynthetic (e.g., green algae) and non-photosynthetic (e.g., fungi) organisms.
     - Found inadequate because many organisms did not fit neatly into either category.
- **Evolution of Classification Systems**: A need arose to include characteristics beyond gross morphology, such as cell structure, nature of cell wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction, and evolutionary relationships.
- Plant and animal kingdoms have been constant under all systems, but the understanding of which groups belong to them has changed. The number and nature of other kingdoms have also varied.

### 2.1 R.H. Whittaker's Five Kingdom Classification (1969)

- **Kingdoms proposed**: Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia.
- **Main criteria for classification**:
     - Cell structure
     - Body organisation
     - Mode of nutrition
     - Reproduction
     - Phylogenetic relationships (evolutionary relationships).
- **Three-domain system**: A more recent proposal that divides Kingdom Monera into two domains, leaving the eukaryotic kingdoms in a third domain, resulting in a six-kingdom classification (details for higher classes).
- **Improvements over earlier systems**:
     - Earlier systems placed diverse groups like bacteria, blue-green algae, fungi, mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms all under 'Plants' simply because they had a cell wall. This grouped prokaryotic bacteria with eukaryotic groups, and unicellular organisms with multicellular ones.
     - Fungi were grouped with green plants, despite their characteristic differences (fungi had chitin cell walls, green plants had cellulosic cell walls) and heterotrophic mode of nutrition.
     - Whittaker's system placed fungi in a separate Kingdom Fungi.
     - All prokaryotic organisms were grouped under Kingdom Monera.
     - All unicellular eukaryotic organisms were placed in Kingdom Protista, bringing together organisms that were previously in different kingdoms (e.g., _Chlamydomonas_ and _Chlorella_ from 'Plants' with _Paramoecium_ and _Amoeba_ from 'Animal kingdom').
- These changes reflect improved understanding of characteristics and evolutionary relationships, a trend expected to continue.

**Table 2.1: Characteristics of the Five Kingdoms**

| Characters            | Monera                                                                                  | Protista                                       | Fungi                                 | Plantae                      | Animalia                                  |

     - Extreme salty areas (**halophiles**)
     - Hot springs (**thermoacidophiles**)
     - Marshy areas (**methanogens**)
- Differ from other bacteria by a **different cell wall structure**, which aids survival in extreme conditions.
- **Methanogens** are present in the gut of ruminant animals (cows, buffaloes) and produce methane (biogas) from dung.

#### 2.1.2 Eubacteria (True Bacteria)

- Characterised by a **rigid cell wall**. If motile, they have a **flagellum**.
- **Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)**:
     - Have **chlorophyll a** (similar to green plants) and are photosynthetic autotrophs.

     - Many are pathogenic in animals and plants.

### 2.3 Kingdom Protista

- Includes **all single-celled eukaryotes**.
- Boundaries are not well-defined, leading to varied classifications among biologists.
- Members are primarily **aquatic**.
- Forms a link with plants, animals, and fungi kingdoms.
- **Eukaryotic cell body**: Well-defined nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
- Some have **flagella or cilia**.

#### 2.2.1 Chrysophytes

- Includes **diatoms** and **golden algae (desmids)**.
- Found in fresh water and marine environments.
- Microscopic and float passively in water currents (**plankton**).
- Most are **photosynthetic**.
- **Diatoms**:
     - Cell walls form two thin overlapping shells that fit like a soapbox.
     - Walls embedded with **silica**, making them indestructible.
     - Leave behind large cell wall deposits forming **'diatomaceous earth'** (used in polishing, filtration of oils and syrups).
     - Are the chief **'producers' in the oceans**.

#### 2.2.2 Dinoflagellates

- Mostly marine and photosynthetic.
- Appear yellow, green, brown, blue, or red depending on main pigments.
- Cell wall has **stiff cellulose plates** on the outer surface.
- Most have **two flagella**: one longitudinal, one transverse in a furrow.
- **Red dinoflagellates** (e.g., _Gonyaulax_) can multiply rapidly, causing **red tides**, and release toxins that kill other marine animals.

#### 2.2.3 Euglenoids

- Majority are freshwater organisms found in stagnant water.
- Instead of a cell wall, they have a **protein-rich layer called pellicle**, which makes their body flexible.
- Have **two flagella** (one short, one long).
- **Mixotrophic**: Photosynthetic in sunlight, but behave as heterotrophs (predating on smaller organisms) when deprived of sunlight.
- Pigments are identical to those in higher plants.
- Example: _Euglena_.

#### 2.2.4 Slime Moulds

- **Saprophytic protists**.
- Body moves along decaying twigs and leaves, engulfing organic material.
- Under suitable conditions, form an aggregation called **plasmodium**, which can grow and spread.
- During unfavourable conditions, plasmodium differentiates into **fruiting bodies** bearing spores at their tips.
- Spores possess **true walls**, are extremely resistant, and survive for years; dispersed by air currents.

#### 2.2.5 Protozoans

- All are **heterotrophs**, living as predators or parasites.
- Believed to be **primitive relatives of animals**.
- **Four major groups**:
     1.    **Amoeboid protozoans**:
           - Live in fresh water, sea water, or moist soil.
           - Move and capture prey using **pseudopodia (false feet)** (e.g., _Amoeba_).
           - Marine forms have **silica shells** on their surface.
           - Some are parasites (e.g., _Entamoeba_).
     2.    **Flagellated protozoans**:
           - Either free-living or parasitic; have **flagella**.
           - Parasitic forms cause diseases (e.g., sleeping sickness by _Trypanosoma_).
     3.    **Ciliated protozoans**:
           - Aquatic, actively moving due to thousands of **cilia**.
           - Have a cavity (**gullet**) that opens to the outside; coordinated ciliary movement steers food-laden water into gullet.
           - Example: _Paramoecium_.
     4.    **Sporozoans**:
           - Diverse organisms with an **infectious spore-like stage** in their life cycle.
           - Example: _Plasmodium_ (malarial parasite), which causes malaria.

### 2.4 Kingdom Fungi

- A **unique kingdom of heterotrophic organisms**.
- Great diversity in morphology and habitat.
- Examples: Mushrooms, toadstools, white spots on mustard leaves (parasitic), yeast (unicellular, used in bread/beer), _Puccinia_ (wheat rust), _Penicillium_ (source of antibiotics).
- **Cosmopolitan**: Occur in air, water, soil, animals, and plants. Prefer warm and humid places (food kept in refrigerators to prevent fungal/bacterial infections).
- **Structure**:
     - Mostly **filamentous** (except unicellular yeasts).
     - Bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures called **hyphae**.
     - Network of hyphae is called **mycelium**.
     - Some hyphae are continuous tubes filled with multinucleated cytoplasm (**coenocytic hyphae**); others have cross walls (**septae**).
     - **Cell walls are composed of chitin and polysaccharides**.
- **Nutrition**:
     - Most are **saprophytes**: Absorb soluble organic matter from dead substrates.
     - Some are **parasites**: Depend on living plants and animals.
     - Can live as **symbionts**:
          - **Lichens**: Association with algae.
          - **Mycorrhiza**: Association with roots of higher plants.
- **Reproduction**:
     - **Vegetative means**: Fragmentation, fission, budding.
     - **Asexual reproduction**: By spores called **conidia**, **sporangiospores**, or **zoospores**. These spores are produced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies.
     - **Sexual reproduction**: By **oospores, ascospores, and basidiospores**.
          - Involves three steps:
               1.    **Plasmogamy**: Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes.
               2.    **Karyogamy**: Fusion of two nuclei.
               3.    **Meiosis in zygote**: Results in haploid spores.
          - In some fungi, fusion of haploid cells immediately results in diploid cells (2n).
          - In other fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening **dikaryotic stage** (n + n, two nuclei per cell) occurs, called **dikaryophase**. Later, parental nuclei fuse to become diploid.
          - Fungi form fruiting bodies where reduction division occurs, leading to haploid spores.
- **Classification Basis**: Morphology of mycelium, mode of spore formation, and fruiting bodies.

#### 2.3.1 Phycomycetes

- Found in aquatic habitats, on decaying wood in moist places, or as **obligate parasites on plants**.
- Mycelium is **aseptate and coenocytic**.
- **Asexual reproduction**: By zoospores (motile) or aplanospores (non-motile); these spores are endogenously produced in sporangium.
- **Sexual reproduction**: A **zygospore** is formed by fusion of two gametes, which can be similar (isogamous) or dissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous) in morphology.
- Examples: _Mucor_, _Rhizopus_ (bread mould), _Albugo_ (parasitic fungi on mustard).

#### 2.3.2 Ascomycetes (Sac-Fungi)

- Mostly multicellular (e.g., _Penicillium_), rarely unicellular (e.g., yeast, _Saccharomyces_).
- Saprophytic, decomposers, parasitic, or **coprophilous** (growing on dung).
- Mycelium is **branched and septate**.
- **Asexual spores**: **Conidia**, produced exogenously on special mycelium called **conidiophores**. Conidia germinate to produce mycelium.
- **Sexual spores**: **Ascospores**, produced endogenously in sac-like **asci** (singular: ascus). Asci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called **ascocarps**.
- Examples: _Aspergillus_, _Claviceps_, _Neurospora_ (used extensively in biochemical and genetic work).
- Many members like morels and truffles are edible delicacies.

#### 2.3.3 Basidiomycetes

- Commonly known forms: Mushrooms, bracket fungi, puffballs.
- Grow in soil, on logs, tree stumps, and in living plant bodies as parasites (e.g., rusts and smuts).
- Mycelium is **branched and septate**.
- **Asexual spores**: Generally not found.
- **Vegetative reproduction**: Common by fragmentation.
- **Sex organs**: Absent. Plasmogamy brought about by fusion of two vegetative or somatic cells of different strains/genotypes.
- Resultant structure is **dikaryotic**, which ultimately gives rise to **basidium**. Karyogamy and meiosis occur in the basidium, producing four basidiospores.
- **Basidiospores**: Exogenously produced on the basidium (pl.: basidia).
- Basidia are arranged in fruiting bodies called **basidiocarps**.
- Examples: _Agaricus_ (mushroom), _Ustilago_ (smut), _Puccinia_ (rust fungus).

#### 2.3.4 Deuteromycetes (Imperfect Fungi)

- Commonly called imperfect fungi because **only the asexual or vegetative phases are known**.
- If sexual forms are discovered, they are moved into their rightful classes (often ascomycetes and basidiomycetes).
- Reproduce only by **asexual spores known as conidia**.
- Mycelium is **septate and branched**.
- Some members are saprophytes or parasites, while a large number are **decomposers of litter** and help in mineral cycling.
- Examples: _Alternaria_, _Colletotrichum_, and _Trichoderma_.

### 2.5 Kingdom Plantae

- Includes all **eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing organisms** commonly called plants.
- A few members are **partially heterotrophic**:
     - **Insectivorous plants**: _Bladderwort_, _Venus fly trap_.
     - **Parasites**: _Cuscuta_.
- **Plant cells**: Eukaryotic structure with prominent chloroplasts and **cell wall mainly made of cellulose**.
- Includes **algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms**.
- **Life cycle**: Has two distinct phases that alternate with each other (**alternation of generations**):
     - Diploid **sporophytic** phase
     - Haploid **gametophytic** phase
- The length and independence of these phases vary among different plant groups.

### 2.6 Kingdom Animalia

- Characterised by **heterotrophic eukaryotic organisms**.
- Are **multicellular** and their cells **lack cell walls**.
- Directly or indirectly depend on plants for food.
- Digest food in an **internal cavity** and store food reserves as **glycogen or fat**.
- Mode of nutrition is **holozoic** (by ingestion of food).
- Follow a **definite growth pattern** and grow into adults with a definite shape and size.
- Higher forms show **elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanisms**.
- Most are capable of **locomotion**.
- **Sexual reproduction**: By copulation of male and female, followed by embryological development.

### 2.7 Viruses, Viroids, Prions, and Lichens

- These are **not mentioned in Whittaker's five kingdom classification**.

#### Viruses

- Not considered truly 'living' if 'living' is defined by cellular structure.
- Are **non-cellular organisms** with an **inert crystalline structure** outside the living cell.
- **Obligate parasites**: Once they infect a cell, they take over the host cell's machinery to replicate, killing the host.
- **History**:
     - **Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892)**: Recognised microbes causing mosaic disease of tobacco; found them smaller than bacteria (passed through filters).
     - **M.W. Beijerinck (1898)**: Called the infectious fluid "Contagium vivum fluidum" (infectious living fluid).
     - **W.M. Stanley (1935)**: Showed viruses could be crystallised, and crystals largely consist of proteins.
- **Composition**:
     - A **nucleoprotein**.
     - Contain **genetic material** (either **RNA or DNA**, never both).
     - The genetic material is infectious.
     - Plant viruses generally have single-stranded RNA.
     - Animal viruses have either single or double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA.
     - Bacterial viruses (**bacteriophages**) are usually double-stranded DNA viruses.
     - **Capsid**: A protein coat made of small subunits called **capsomeres**, which protects the nucleic acid. Capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral geometric forms.
- **Diseases**:
     - **Humans**: Mumps, smallpox, herpes, influenza, AIDS.
     - **Plants**: Mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing, vein clearing, dwarfing, stunted growth.

#### Viroids

- **T.O. Diener (1971)**: Discovered a new infectious agent smaller than viruses that caused potato spindle tuber disease.
- Found to be a **free RNA**.
- **Lacked the protein coat** found in viruses.
- RNA of low molecular weight.

#### Prions

- Infectious agents consisting of **abnormally folded protein**.
- Similar in size to viruses.
- Cause certain infectious **neurological diseases**.
- Examples: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, 'mad cow disease' in cattle) and its analogous variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in humans.

#### Lichens

- **Symbiotic associations** (mutually useful) between **algae and fungi**.
     - **Algal component (phycobiont)**: Autotrophic, prepares food for fungi.
     - **Fungal component (mycobiont)**: Heterotrophic, provides shelter and absorbs mineral nutrients and water for the alga.
- Their association is so close that they appear as a single organism in nature.
- Very good **pollution indicators** – they do not grow in polluted areas.

## Chapter 3: Plant Kingdom

### 3.1 Overview and Classification Systems

- **Kingdom Plantae** in Whittaker's system now excludes Fungi, Monera, and Protista (even those with cell walls), unlike earlier classifications. Cyanobacteria are no longer considered 'algae' in this context.
- The Plant Kingdom includes **Algae, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms, and Angiosperms**.
- **Classification Systems within Angiosperms**:
     - **Earlier Artificial Systems**:
          - Used only **gross superficial morphological characters** (habit, colour, number/shape of leaves).
          - Mainly based on vegetative characters or androecium structure (e.g., Linnaeus' system).
          - **Separated closely related species** because they were based on few characteristics.
          - Gave **equal weightage to vegetative and sexual characteristics**, which is not ideal as vegetative characters are more easily affected by the environment.
     - **Natural Classification Systems**:
          - Based on **natural affinities among organisms**.
          - Considered **external features** as well as **internal features** (ultrastructure, anatomy, embryology, phytochemistry).
          - Example for flowering plants: Given by **George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker**.
     - **Phylogenetic Classification Systems**:
          - Currently **acceptable**, based on **evolutionary relationships** between organisms.
          - Assumes organisms in the same taxa have a **common ancestor**.
          - Use information from many sources, especially when fossil evidence is lacking.
     - **Numerical Taxonomy**:
          - Easily carried out using **computers**.
          - Based on **all observable characteristics**.
          - Numbers and codes assigned to characters, data processed.
          - Each character given **equal importance**, and hundreds of characters can be considered.
     - **Cytotaxonomy**: Based on **cytological information** (chromosome number, structure, behaviour).
     - **Chemotaxonomy**: Uses the **chemical constituents** of the plant to resolve classification confusions.

### 3.2 Algae

- **Characteristics**: Chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid (undifferentiated body), autotrophic, and largely aquatic (fresh water and marine).
- **Habitats**: Moist stones, soils, wood. Some associate with fungi (lichen) or animals (sloth bear).

          - **Anisogamous**: Gametes are dissimilar in size (e.g., _Eudorina_).
          - **Oogamous**: Fusion between a large, non-motile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete (e.g., _Volvox_, _Fucus_).
- **Economic Importance**:
     - Perform at least half of the total CO2 fixation on Earth through photosynthesis, increasing dissolved oxygen.
     - Paramount as **primary producers** in aquatic food cycles.
     - **Food**: Many species of marine algae (e.g., _Porphyra_, _Laminaria_, _Sargassum_) are consumed.

     - **Agar**: Commercial product from _Gelidium_ and _Gracilaria_, used to grow microbes and in preparations of ice-creams and jellies.
     - **Chlorella**: A unicellular alga rich in proteins, used as a food supplement, even by space travellers.
- **Classes**: Divided into three main classes: Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae, and Rhodophyceae.

#### 3.1.1 Chlorophyceae (Green Algae)

- Commonly called **green algae** due to dominance of chlorophyll a and b pigments.
- Plant body: Unicellular, colonial, or filamentous.
- Pigments localised in definite chloroplasts, which can be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral, or ribbon-shaped.
- **Pyrenoids**: One or more storage bodies located in chloroplasts; contain protein besides starch. Some store food as oil droplets.
- **Cell wall**: Rigid, made of an inner layer of cellulose and an outer layer of pectose.
- **Reproduction**:
     - Vegetative: Usually by fragmentation.
     - Asexual: By flagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia.
     - Sexual: Shows considerable variation, can be isogamous, anisogamous, or oogamous.

- **Reproduction**:
     - Vegetative: By fragmentation.
     - Asexual: By **biflagellate zoospores** (pear-shaped with two unequal laterally attached flagella).
     - Sexual: May be isogamous, anisogamous, or oogamous. Gamete union can be in water or within the oogonium (for oogamous species). Gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear two laterally attached flagella.
- Examples: _Ectocarpus_, _Dictyota_, _Laminaria_, _Sargassum_, _Fucus_.

#### 3.1.3 Rhodophyceae (Red Algae)

- Commonly called **red algae** due to predominance of the red pigment, **r-phycoerythrin**.
- Majority are **marine**, with higher concentrations in warmer areas.
- Found in both well-lighted surface waters and great depths where little light penetrates.
- Thalli of most are **multicellular** and can have complex body organisation.
- Food stored as **floridean starch**, which is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure.
- **Reproduction**:
     - Vegetative: Usually by fragmentation.
     - Asexual: By **non-motile spores**.
     - Sexual: By **non-motile gametes**; it is oogamous and accompanied by complex post-fertilisation developments.

### 3.3 Bryophytes

- Includes various **mosses and liverworts**.
- Found commonly growing in **moist shaded areas** in the hills.
- Called **amphibians of the plant kingdom** because they can live in soil but depend on water for sexual reproduction.
- Usually occur in damp, humid, and shaded localities.
- **Ecological Importance**:
     - Play an important role in **plant succession** on bare rocks/soil by decomposing rocks and making substrate suitable for higher plants.
     - Mosses form dense mats on soil, reducing impact of rain and preventing **soil erosion**.
     - Some mosses provide food for herbaceous mammals, birds, and other animals.
     - Species of _Sphagnum_ (a moss) provide **peat**, used as fuel and packing material for trans-shipment due to high water-holding capacity.
- **Plant Body**: More differentiated than algae.
     - Thallus-like, prostrate or erect, attached to substratum by unicellular or multicellular **rhizoids**.
     - Lack true roots, stem, or leaves, but may possess root-like, leaf-like, or stem-like structures.
- **Main plant body**: **Haploid gametophyte**, which produces gametes.
- **Sex Organs**: Multicellular.
     - **Antheridium** (male sex organ): Produces biflagellate **antherozoids**.
     - **Archegonium** (female sex organ): Flask-shaped, produces a single egg.
- **Fertilisation**: Antherozoids are released into water, come in contact with archegonium, and fuse with the egg to produce the **zygote**.
- **Sporophyte**: The zygote does not undergo reduction division immediately but produces a multicellular body called a sporophyte.
     - Not free-living, but **attached to the photosynthetic gametophyte** and derives nourishment from it.
     - Some cells undergo **meiosis** to produce haploid **spores**.
     - These spores germinate to produce a new gametophyte.
- **Divisions**: Bryophytes are divided into liverworts and mosses.

#### 3.2.1 Liverworts

- Grow in moist, shady habitats like stream banks, marshy ground, damp soil, bark of trees, and deep in woods.
- **Plant body**: Thalloid (e.g., _Marchantia_), dorsiventral, and closely appressed to the substrate. Leafy members have tiny leaf-like appendages in two rows on stem-like structures.
- **Asexual reproduction**:
     - By **fragmentation of thalli**.
     - By specialised structures called **gemmae** (singular: gemma). Gemmae are green, multicellular, asexual buds that develop in small receptacles called **gemma cups** on the thalli. They detach and germinate to form new individuals.
- **Sexual reproduction**: Male and female sex organs produced on same or different thalli.
     - The sporophyte is differentiated into a **foot, seta, and capsule**.
     - Spores are produced after meiosis within the capsule.
     - These spores germinate to form free-living gametophytes.

#### 3.2.2 Mosses

- **Predominant stage**: The gametophyte, which consists of two stages.
     1.    **Protonema stage**: Develops directly from a spore; creeping, green, branched, frequently filamentous.
     2.    **Leafy stage**: Develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud; consists of upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. Attached to soil by multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears the sex organs.
- **Vegetative reproduction**: By fragmentation and budding in the secondary protonema.
- **Sexual reproduction**: Antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots.
     - After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a **sporophyte** (foot, seta, and capsule).
     - The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than in liverworts.
     - The capsule contains spores formed after meiosis.
     - Mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal.
- Examples: _Funaria_, _Polytrichum_, and _Sphagnum_.

### 3.4 Pteridophytes

- Includes **horsetails and ferns**.
- **Uses**: Medicinal purposes, soil-binders, ornamentals.
- **Evolutionary significance**: They are the **first terrestrial plants to possess vascular tissues (xylem and phloem)**.
- **Habitats**: Found in cool, damp, shady places; some may flourish in sandy-soil conditions.
- **Main plant body**: **Sporophyte**, which is the dominant phase.
     - Differentiated into **true root, stem, and leaves**.
     - These organs possess well-differentiated vascular tissues.
- **Leaves**:
     - Small (**microphylls**), as in _Selaginella_.
     - Large (**macrophylls**), as in ferns.
- **Sporangia**: Bear sporangia, subtended by leaf-like appendages called **sporophylls**.
- **Strobili or Cones**: In some cases, sporophylls may form distinct compact structures (e.g., _Selaginella_, _Equisetum_).
- **Spores**: Sporangia produce spores by meiosis in spore mother cells.
     - Spores germinate to give rise to inconspicuous, small but multicellular, free-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called **prothallus**.
- **Gametophytes**: Require cool, damp, shady places to grow. This specific requirement and need for water for fertilisation limit the spread of living pteridophytes to narrow geographical regions.
- **Sex Organs on Gametophytes**:
     - Male sex organs: **Antheridia**.
     - Female sex organs: **Archegonia**.
- **Fertilisation**: Water is required for transfer of antherozoids (male gametes) from antheridia to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete with egg forms a **zygote**.
- The zygote produces a multicellular, well-differentiated sporophyte.
- **Homosporous**: In the majority of pteridophytes, all spores are of similar kinds.
- **Heterosporous**: Genera like _Selaginella_ and _Salvinia_ produce two kinds of spores – **macro (large)** and **micro (small) spores**.
     - Megaspores and microspores germinate to give rise to female and male gametophytes, respectively.
     - Female gametophytes are retained on the parent sporophytes for variable periods.
     - The development of zygotes into young embryos within the female gametophytes is a **precursor to the seed habit**, considered an important step in evolution.
- **Classes**: Classified into four classes:
     - **Psilopsida**: (_Psilotum_)
     - **Lycopsida**: (_Selaginella_, _Lycopodium_)
     - **Sphenopsida**: (_Equisetum_)
     - **Pteropsida**: (_Dryopteris_, _Pteris_, _Adiantum_)

### 3.5 Gymnosperms

- **"Naked seeds"**: The term **gymnos (naked), sperma (seeds)**. Ovules are **not enclosed by any ovary wall** and remain exposed both before and after fertilisation. The seeds that develop post-fertilisation are not covered.
- **Size**: Include medium-sized trees or tall trees and shrubs. The giant redwood tree _Sequoia_ is one of the tallest tree species.
- **Roots**: Generally **tap roots**.
     - In some genera (_Pinus_), roots have **fungal association in the form of mycorrhiza**.
     - In others (_Cycas_), small specialised roots called **coralloid roots** are associated with N2-fixing cyanobacteria.
- **Stems**: Unbranched (_Cycas_) or branched (_Pinus_, _Cedrus_).
- **Leaves**: May be simple or compound.
     - In _Cycas_, pinnate leaves persist for a few years.
     - Leaves are well-adapted to withstand extremes of temperature, humidity, and wind.
     - In conifers, needle-like leaves reduce surface area; thick cuticle and sunken stomata also reduce water loss.
- **Heterosporous**: They produce haploid **microspores** and **megaspores**.
- **Sporangia and Strobili/Cones**: The two kinds of spores are produced within sporangia borne on sporophylls, which are arranged spirally along an axis to form lax or compact strobili or cones.
     - **Male strobili (microsporangiate)**: Bear microsporophylls and microsporangia.
          - Microspores develop into a highly reduced male gametophytic generation (a few cells) called a **pollen grain**.
          - Development of pollen grains takes place within the microsporangia.
     - **Female strobili (macrosporangiate)**: Bear megasporophylls with ovules or megasporangia.
     - Male or female cones/strobili may be borne on the **same tree** (_Pinus_) or on **different trees** (_Cycas_).
- **Megaspore Formation**:
     - The megaspore mother cell differentiates from one of the cells of the nucellus.
     - The nucellus is protected by envelopes, forming the composite structure called an **ovule**.
     - Ovules are borne on megasporophylls, which may be clustered to form female cones.
     - The megaspore mother cell divides meiotically to form **four megaspores**.
     - One of the megaspores, enclosed within the megasporangium, develops into a multicellular **female gametophyte** that bears two or more archegonia (female sex organs).
     - The multicellular female gametophyte is retained within the megasporangium.
- **Gametophytes**: Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, male and female gametophytes **do not have an independent free-living existence**; they remain within the sporangia retained on the sporophytes.
- **Pollination and Fertilisation**:
     - Pollen grains are released from the microsporangium and carried by air currents.
     - They come in contact with the opening of the ovules borne on megasporophylls.
     - The pollen tube, carrying male gametes, grows towards archegonia in the ovules and discharges contents near the mouth.
     - Following fertilisation, the zygote develops into an **embryo**, and the ovules develop into **seeds** (which are uncovered).

### 3.6 Angiosperms

- **Flowering plants**.
- Unlike gymnosperms, ovules are **enclosed in specialised structures called flowers**.
- After fertilisation, the seeds are **enclosed in fruits**.
- An exceptionally large group of plants found in a **wide range of habitats**.
- Size varies from the smallest _Wolffia_ to tall trees of _Eucalyptus_ (over 100 meters).
- Provide food, fodder, fuel, medicines, and several other commercially important products.
- **Classes**: Divided into two classes:
     - **Dicotyledons**
     - **Monocotyledons**

## Chapter 4: Animal Kingdom

### 4.1 Basis of Classification

- With over a million animal species described, classification is crucial for assigning systematic positions to newly described species.
- Despite differences in structure and form, fundamental features common to various animals are used as the basis for classification.

#### 4.1.1 Levels of Organisation

- All members of Animalia are **multicellular** but exhibit different patterns of cell organisation.
     - **Cellular Level of Organisation**: Cells arranged as loose aggregates, with some division of labour (e.g., **sponges**).
     - **Tissue Level of Organisation**: Cells performing the same function are arranged into tissues (e.g., **coelenterates**, **ctenophores**).
     - **Organ Level of Organisation**: Tissues are grouped to form organs, each specialised for a particular function (e.g., **Platyhelminthes** and other higher phyla).
     - **Organ System Level of Organisation**: Organs associate to form functional systems, each concerned with a specific physiological function (e.g., **Annelids, Arthropods, Molluscs, Echinoderms, Hemichordates, Chordates**).
- **Complexities in Organ Systems**:
     - **Digestive System**:
          - **Incomplete**: Single opening serving as both mouth and anus (e.g., Platyhelminthes).
          - **Complete**: Two openings, mouth and anus.
     - **Circulatory System**:
          - **Open type**: Blood is pumped out of the heart, directly bathing cells and tissues.
          - **Closed type**: Blood is circulated through a series of vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries).

#### 4.1.2 Symmetry

- Animals can be categorised based on their body symmetry.
     - **Asymmetrical**: Any plane passing through the centre does not divide them into equal halves (e.g., **sponges**).
     - **Radial Symmetry**: Any plane passing through the central axis divides the organism into two identical halves (e.g., **Coelenterates, Ctenophores, Echinoderms**).
     - **Bilateral Symmetry**: The body can be divided into identical left and right halves in only one plane (e.g., **Annelids, Arthropods**). (Note: Echinodermata larvae are bilaterally symmetrical, but adults are radial).

#### 4.1.3 Diploblastic and Triploblastic Organisation

- **Diploblastic Animals**: Cells arranged in two embryonic layers:
     - External **ectoderm**
     - Internal **endoderm**
     - An undifferentiated layer, **mesoglea**, is present between the ectoderm and endoderm (e.g., **coelenterates**, **ctenophores**).
- **Triploblastic Animals**: Developing embryo has a third germinal layer, **mesoderm**, between the ectoderm and endoderm (e.g., **Platyhelminthes to Chordates**).

#### 4.1.4 Coelom (Body Cavity)

- **Coelom**: Body cavity lined by mesoderm.
     - **Coelomates**: Animals possessing a coelom (e.g., **annelids, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, hemichordates, and chordates**).
- **Pseudocoelom**: Body cavity not lined by mesoderm; mesoderm is present as scattered pouches between the ectoderm and endoderm.
     - **Pseudocoelomates**: Animals possessing a pseudocoelom (e.g., **aschelminthes**).
- **Acoelomates**: Animals in which the body cavity is absent (e.g., **platyhelminthes**).

#### 4.1.5 Segmentation

- In some animals, the body is externally and internally divided into segments with a serial repetition of at least some organs.
- This pattern is called **metameric segmentation**, and the phenomenon is known as **metamerism** (e.g., **earthworm**).

#### 4.1.6 Notochord

- A **mesodermally derived rod-like structure** formed on the dorsal side during embryonic development in some animals.
- **Chordates**: Animals with a notochord.
- **Non-chordates**: Animals that do not form this structure (e.g., Porifera to Echinoderms).
