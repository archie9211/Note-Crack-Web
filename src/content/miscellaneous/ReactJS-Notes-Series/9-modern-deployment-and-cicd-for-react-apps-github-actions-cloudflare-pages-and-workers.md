# Article 9: Modern Deployment and CI/CD for React Apps — Featuring GitHub Actions, Cloudflare Pages, and Workers

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this article, you will:

- Know **how to automate building, testing, and deploying** React apps using modern CI/CD pipelines.
- Understand best practices for seamless, zero-downtime deployment—fit for both startups and industry giants.
- Confidently deploy React projects to [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) and harness [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/) for backend and edge logic (with special tips for fans!).
- Practice DevOps skills that recruiters and top teams value.

## Why Modern Deployment and CI/CD?

Shipping features fast isn't enough—**your app needs to reach users reliably and safely, every time.**
With Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (**CI/CD**), every code change is automatically tested and published.
For Indian developers, this shift means less worrying about “deployment-day disasters,” and more productivity as a team.

**[Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) and [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/) are changing the game—offering global scale, security, and edge computing, often for free.**

## Overview: Deployment Options for React in 2025

- **[Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/):** Jamstack-friendly, instant global edge deployment, zero config, free tier for hobby to pro.
- **[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/):** Run backend code/functions “at the edge” for lightning-fast APIs alongside your static front-end.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/):** Also popular for React, with automatic deployments from Git.
- **[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static/):** Enterprise-oriented alternatives.
- **[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-github-actions):** The CI/CD system that ties it all together—build, test, and deploy from your repo.

## End-to-End Deployment Flow

1. **Push code to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).**
2. **[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-github-actions) runs tests, builds the app, lints code, and optionally deploys artifacts.**
3. **[Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) (or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)/[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)) picks up your branch, builds, and deploys globally.**
4. **Preview URLs** for every pull request, ensuring safe reviews before going live.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages: The Developer’s Dream

### Why Choose Cloudflare Pages?

- Seamless GitHub integration—auto-deploy on every push.
- **Indian users** (and global!) get fast, secure experience thanks to Cloudflare’s edge.
- Preview deployments for QA, pull requests, and team review.
- Zero config: works out of the box with React ([Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), CRA, etc.).

### Quick Start

1. **Create your React app locally** ([Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), or any modern setup).
2. **Push it to GitHub.**
3. **Connect your repo to Cloudflare Pages:**

      - Go to Cloudflare dashboard → Pages → Create Application → Connect to Git.
      - Choose your repo, set build command (`npm run build`), and build directory (`dist` for Vite, `build` for CRA).

4. **Cloudflare auto-builds and deploys** on every git push—including to preview branches.
5. Share your live app at: `https://your-app.pages.dev`

See [Cloudflare’s docs for React setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/) for more details.

## Using Cloudflare Workers with React

**Workers let you run serverless code (e.g., APIs, authentication, routing) right beside your static app, globally.**

### Typical Use Cases

- Implement custom backend APIs (orders, chat, payments) with near-zero latency.
- Modify responses “at the edge” (e.g., localization, A/B tests, analytics).
- Run SSR/React Router logic via Workers for lightning-fast navigation ([React Router Worker Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/)).

### How to Use

1. **Build your React app with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or similar tooling.**
2. **Add Cloudflare Worker using [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/):**

      - `npm install wrangler --save-dev`
      - Configure via `wrangler.toml` for build/deploy.

3. **Develop locally and deploy:**

      - Run and test your Worker functions alongside your React app.
      - Deploy both static assets and API logic via the Cloudflare platform.

4. **CI/CD ready:** Connect to GitHub and automatically deploy with each commit.

## Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-github-actions)** automates your workflow for React apps:

- Build, test, lint on every push/PR.
- Deploy to Pages, Vercel, AWS, or any platform automatically.
- Enforce code quality with automated checks—no more manual releases!

### Example: GitHub Actions Workflow for React + Cloudflare Pages

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Build and Deploy React App

on:
      push:
            branches: [main]
      pull_request:

jobs:
      build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest

            steps:
                  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
                  - name: Use Node.js
                    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
                    with:
                          node-version: 20
                  - run: npm ci
                  - run: npm run build
                  - name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
                    uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1
                    with:
                          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
                          accountId: ${{ secrets.CF_ACCOUNT_ID }}
                          projectName: your-pages-project
                          directory: ./dist
```

Replace `your-pages-project` and secrets with your Cloudflare details for secure, automated deploys. See [CI/CD pipeline with React & GitHub Actions](https://faun.pub/ci-cd-pipeline-with-react-app-using-github-actions-1b219d4e162f) for details.

## Real-World Best Practices for Indian Teams

- **Preview Deploys:** Use branch-specific previews for QA and stakeholder demos—no more “it works on my machine”!
- **Automate everything:** Lint, test, build, and deploy—consistent quality.
- **Keep secrets safe:** Use GitHub’s secrets manager for API keys and tokens.
- **Monitor and rollback easily:** Cloudflare Pages keeps deployment history for quick fixes.

## Cloudflare Workers: The Secret Super-Charge

- **Use Workers for:**

     - Lightning-fast REST/API endpoints (auth, search, webhooks)
     - SSR for [React Router v7](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/)
     - Edge caching and smart routing

- **Full-stack feel—without servers!**
- Indian startups: Avoid expensive servers—run logic globally on-demand.

## Practice Exercises

1. **CI Pipeline:**
   Set up a [GitHub Actions pipeline](https://docs.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-github-actions) that builds, tests, and deploys your React app to [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-react-site/).
2. **Edge Function:**
   Write a simple [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) that adds a custom HTTP header to your React app for analytics.
3. **Preview Deploy:**
   Push a pull request and check the preview deploy URL from Cloudflare Pages.

## Project Idea

**Professional Feature:**
Build and deploy an end-to-end e-commerce storefront:

- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions, linting and testing.
- Frontend on Cloudflare Pages, API logic on Workers.
- Preview URLs for every PR. Bonus: India-specific currency formatting “at the edge” using a Worker.
