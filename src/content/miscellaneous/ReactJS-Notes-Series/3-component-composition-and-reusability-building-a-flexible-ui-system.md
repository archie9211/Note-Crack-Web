# Article 3: Component Composition and Reusability — Building a Flexible UI System

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this article, you will:

- Understand **what component composition means** in React and why it's the backbone of scalable, maintainable apps.
- Discover **patterns for composing components**—from children and props to advanced techniques like higher-order components and custom hooks.
- Learn to design **reusable, flexible components** following modern industry practices.
- Recognize the distinction between “presentational” and “container” components, and know when and how to use each.
- Practice with hands-on exercises and project ideas that turn theory into practical UI craftsmanship.

## Why Component Composition? The Power of Lego-Like UIs

Imagine you're constructing a sprawling apartment complex. You wouldn't reinvent each floor, pillar, or balcony; instead, you'd use standardized designs that fit together perfectly. **That's exactly how React's component composition works.**
By composing simple components into more complex ones, you avoid code duplication, boost maintainability, and give your UI team superpowers for rapid iteration.

**In India's tech scene, where teams need to deliver quality and features fast, composition and reusability are keys to scaling projects efficiently—whether it's building fintech dashboards or educational platforms.**

## The Basics: Composition over Inheritance

React encourages **composition**, not inheritance.
That means you combine smaller, focused components together, rather than extending big "base" components.

### Example: Building with Composition

```jsx
// Button.js
export function Button({ children, onClick }) {
      return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
}

// Dialog.js
export function Dialog({ title, children }) {
      return (
            <div className="dialog">
                  <h3>{title}</h3>
                  {children}
            </div>
      );
}

// Usage
<Dialog title="Login Required">
      <Button onClick={handleLogin}>Log In</Button>
</Dialog>;
```

See how the `Dialog` accepts **children**?
This is the most basic, yet powerful, tool for composing components in React.

## Component Reusability: Write Once, Use Everywhere

Reusable components make your development lightning fast.

**What makes a component reusable?**

- Accepts dynamic data via props.
- Avoids hard-coding styles, text, or behavior.
- Has a clear, focused purpose (“does one thing well”).

**Example: A Reusable Card**

```jsx
export function Card({ title, content, footer }) {
      return (
            <div className="card">
                  <h4>{title}</h4>
                  <div>{content}</div>
                  <div>{footer}</div>
            </div>
      );
}
// Usage
<Card
      title="React Jobs in Noida"
      content="10 new opportunities."
      footer={<Button>Apply Now</Button>}
/>;
```

## The Special Power of `children` Prop

The `children` prop is a built-in way to let you pass JSX into any component.

**Why use `children`?**

- Decouples layout/structure from content.
- Lets you nest components flexibly.

```jsx
function FancyBorder({ children }) {
      return <div className="fancy-border">{children}</div>;
}

<FancyBorder>
      <p>This is inside a border!</p>
</FancyBorder>;
```

## Advanced Composition Patterns

### 1. Render Props

A technique for sharing code between components using a function as a prop.

**Pattern:**

```jsx
function DataFetcher({ url, children }) {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);
      // fetch data (omitted)
      return children(data);
}

// Usage
<DataFetcher url="/api/jobs">
      {(data) => (data ? <JobList jobs={data} /> : <Spinner />)}
</DataFetcher>;
```

### 2. Higher-Order Components (HoCs)

A function that takes a component and returns a new component. Used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication or logging.

**Pattern:**

```jsx
function withLoading(Component) {
      return function WrappedComponent({ isLoading, ...props }) {
            if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;
            return <Component {...props} />;
      };
}
// Usage: const JobsWithLoading = withLoading(JobsList);
```

**Note:**
Modern React favors hooks over many HoC use-cases, but you’ll spot HoCs in many real projects.

### 3. Custom Hooks

Encapsulate reusable logic outside the UI tree.

```jsx
function useCounter(initial = 0) {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(initial);
      const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1);
      return [count, increment];
}
```

## Presentational vs. Container Components (Smart \& Dumb)

- **Presentational (Dumb) Components:**
     - Only display data via props; no business logic.
     - Examples: `Button`, `Avatar`, `ProfileCard`.
- **Container (Smart) Components:**
     - Handle data fetching, state, and logic.
     - Pass data to presentational components as props.

**Why?**
This separation keeps your UI clean and maintainable—designers can work on look-and-feel, while developers focus on logic.

## Industry Best Practices \& Tips

- **Small, focused components** are easier to test, reuse, and maintain.
- Always **prefer composition to inheritance.**
- Use the `children` prop for flexible layouts and slots.
- Make UI components stateless when possible; delegate data and logic.
- Use custom hooks for sharing logic instead of HoCs unless needed for legacy or third-party code.
- Document your reusable components—they’ll be part of your team’s “toolbox.”

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Monolithic components:** Trying to do too much—break them up!
- **Hardcoding values:** Don’t tie your component to one use-case.
- **Uncontrolled use of Context/Redux:** Keep data as local as possible.

## Practice Exercises

1. **Reusable Button:** Create a Button component that accepts children, a type (`primary`, `secondary`), and an onClick handler.
   Use it for various roles—Submit, Cancel, Delete.
2. **Composed Layout:** Create a `PageLayout` component that renders a sidebar, header, and main content using children and props.
3. **Render Prop Challenge:** Build a Tooltip component that shows info when hovered, using a render prop for its trigger.

## Project Idea

**Professional Feature:**
Build a Dashboard layout with Sidebar, Topbar, and Content area. Each area is a composable component.

- Use props and children for maximum flexibility.
- Add widgets (Weather, News, Notifications) as reusable components to the content area.
