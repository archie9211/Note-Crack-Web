# Article 11: Industry-Standard Libraries, Tools, and Anti-Patterns — Shipping React Like a Pro

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this article, you will:

- Confidently use core industry libraries—like **React Router** and **styled-components**—that power scalable real-world React apps.
- Learn best practices for integrating these tools into your workflow, ensuring maintainable, testable, and future-proof code.
- Spot and avoid common **React anti-patterns** that slow teams and introduce subtle bugs—unlocking a more productive developer experience.
- Practice refactoring and modernizing apps with code examples and practical tips.

## React Router: Navigation for Modern Single-Page Apps

**Why is it essential?**  
Most professional React apps need multiple pages or views—routing makes navigation seamless, enables dynamic URLs, and lets you build truly interactive SPAs.

### Best Practices

- **Centralize Routing:** Define routes in a dedicated file for clarity and maintainability ([Best Practices](https://namastedev.com/blog/react-router-dom-best-practices/)).
- **Utilize Dynamic Routing & Nested Routes:** Supports layouts, dynamic pages, dashboards, and more.
- **Lazy Load Routes:** Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to split code and speed up initial loads.
- **404 Handling:** Add a catch-all route for unknown paths.
- **Route Guards:** Protect sensitive areas (like admin or user-only pages) with authentication checks.
- **Use `Link` and `NavLink`:** For navigation—never `<a>` for internal routing.

**Example: A Modern Routing Setup**

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

const Home = lazy(() => import("./Home"));
const Profile = lazy(() => import("./Profile"));
const NotFound = lazy(() => import("./NotFound"));

function AppRoutes() {
      return (
            <BrowserRouter>
                  <nav>
                        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
                        <Link to="/profile">Profile</Link>
                  </nav>
                  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
                        <Routes>
                              <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                              <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
                              <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />{" "}
                              {/* 404 */}
                        </Routes>
                  </Suspense>
            </BrowserRouter>
      );
}
```

- **Branch Preview**: With modern hosts (Cloudflare/Vercel), every branch or PR can get a preview link—review real navigation before merging.

## styled-components: Component-Oriented Styling

**Why styled-components?**
Traditional CSS can get tangled as your app grows. **styled-components** lets you scope styles to components—no more “class name collisions”—and enables powerful dynamic and theme-driven UIs ([Docs](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)).

### Best Practices

- **Define styles outside render:** Keeps styled components from being recreated on every render, improving performance ([Guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/styled-components/), [Docs](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)).
- **Use transient props:** (props starting with `$`) for style-only data. These don't get passed as HTML attributes.

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
      background: ${(p) => (p.$primary ? "blue" : "gray")};
`;
<Button $primary>Login</Button>;
```

- **Build a design system:** Centralize colors, spacings, and typography using themes.
- **Prefer component-based styles:** One styled-component per UI/role, not for every HTML tag.
- **Avoid inline styles:** Use props or themes for dynamic changes.
- **Polymorphic components:** Custom `as` prop lets you reuse a styled component for different HTML elements (`as="a"` for a button-as-link).
- **Debug-friendly:** Enable `displayName` in dev for clear class names.

## Avoiding React Anti-Patterns: Coding for the Future

Every React developer—even seasoned ones!—falls into “anti-pattern” traps. Awareness = cleaner, more robust code.

### Most Common React Anti-Patterns (and How to Avoid Them)

1. **Direct State Mutation**
   ❌ `todos.push(newTodo);`
   ✅ `setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);`
   Use state setters—immutability is key ([Guide](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/quiz/what-are-some-react-anti-patterns), [Blog](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/10-react-anti-patterns-to-avoid-as-a-react-developer-bc465f3d0f6f), [Best Practices](https://talent500.com/blog/anti-patterns-in-react-that-you-should-avoid/)).

2. **Using Array Index as Key**
   ❌ `<ListItem key={index} />`
   ✅ `<ListItem key={item.id} />`

3. **Declaring Functions in Render**
   ❌ `onClick={() => doSomething()}`
   ✅ `const handleClick = useCallback(doSomething, []);`

4. **Deeply Nested State** – Flatten state where possible.

5. **Conditional Hooks** – Hooks must run in the same order every render.

6. **Prop Drilling** – Prefer Context or state libraries ([Patterns](https://www.mindbowser.com/modern-react-design-patterns/)).

7. **Defining Components Inside Components** – Avoid unnecessary recreation.

8. **Not Adding All Dependencies to `useEffect`** – Follow linter recommendations.

### Other Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don’t fetch data in deprecated lifecycle methods (`componentWillMount`)
- Don’t use `<a>` for internal navigation
- Don’t wrap components in unnecessary fragments
- Avoid using hooks after returns or inside conditions

## Practice Exercises

1. **Refactor for Keys:** Swap index keys with real IDs.
2. **styled-components Challenge:** Build a `ThemeProvider` and light/dark mode switcher.
3. **Spot the Anti-Pattern:** Audit code for state mutation, prop drilling, etc.
4. **Lazy Loading Route:** Add `React.lazy` to a rarely used page.

## Project Idea

**Pro Feature:**
Integrate React Router, `styled-components`, and best practices into your ongoing project.

- Add authentication-protected routes.
- Refactor styling to styled-components. Build a theme switcher.
- Fix any anti-patterns in the codebase.
