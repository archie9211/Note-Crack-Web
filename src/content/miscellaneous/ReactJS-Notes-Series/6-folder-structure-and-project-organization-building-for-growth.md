# Article 6: Folder Structure and Project Organization — Building for Growth

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this article, you will:

- Organize React projects with **professional folder structures** that scale from hobby to enterprise size.
- Understand **feature-driven and domain-driven architectures** common in the industry.
- Learn best practices for **co-locating files, separating concerns,** and onboarding new developers with ease.
- Practice restructuring a real app for clarity, maintainability, and growth.


## Why Does Structure Matter?

**Imagine:**

- Your app is a mini start-up today.
- Tomorrow, it needs a new chat feature—and a new developer joins the team.
- If your codebase is a “spaghetti plate,” adding features or hunting bugs becomes a nightmare.

**A clear and logical structure** saves hours (or days) of developer time, reduces onboarding headache, and is a hallmark of job-ready, industry-standard React teams everywhere.

## Project Organization Patterns

### 1. The “Classic” Structure

Many generated React projects look like this:

```
/src
  /components
  /pages
  /utils
  /assets
  App.js
  index.js
```

- Good for _very small projects_.
- Can grow messy as component count explodes.


### 2. Feature-Based Structure (Recommended)

A structure where everything related to a single feature—UI, logic, tests, styles—is together.

```
/src
  /features
    /auth
      AuthForm.js
      authSlice.js
      authAPI.js
      AuthForm.test.js
      styles.module.css
    /products
      ProductList.js
      productAPI.js
      ProductList.test.js
  /components
    Button.js
    Modal.js
  /app
    store.js
    rootReducer.js
  /hooks
  /utils
  /assets
```

**Why this rocks:**

- You find _everything for a feature_ in one place.
- Easily move or remove features.
- Supports parallel work and scaling.


### 3. Domain-Driven Structure (Very Large Projects)

Organize by business domain: `/users`, `/orders`, `/dashboard`, etc.
Each domain can further contain components, hooks, API files, etc.

## Co-locating Files: Keep What’s Related, Together

**Instead of:**

```
/components
  ProductCard.js
  ProductCard.css
/pages
  Shop.js
/tests
  ProductCard.test.js
```

**Prefer:**

```
/features/products
  ProductCard.js
  ProductCard.module.css
  ProductCard.test.js
```

- Makes maintenance and updates a breeze.
- No more clicking all over to track down related files.


## Shared vs Feature Components

**Feature Components** live under `/features/[featureName]`.
**Shared or UI Components** (generic buttons, modals, icons) live under `/components`.
This encourages reuse _without_ accidental cross-feature coupling.

## Real-World Best Practices

- **Flat is better than deep:** Avoid nesting folders more than 3-4 deep.
- **Consistent naming**: Use `PascalCase` for files and folders.
- **Index files for cleaner imports:** Export public API of a folder via `index.js`.
- **Separate business logic from UI:** Keep API, state, and UI distinct.
- **Documentation:** Use `README.md` or comments for tricky folder contents.


## Keeping Structure Clean as You Grow

- **Start simple, reorganize when needed.** Don’t over-engineer from day one.
- When adding a feature, put everything (UI, hook, API, test) in one folder.
- Archive/deprecate old features in a `/legacy` or `/deprecated` directory.


## Tooling Support

- Many frameworks (Create React App, Vite, Next.js) give you a starter layout—customize as you grow.
- Some CLIs (like Nx, Turborepo) offer advanced, modular setups for huge monorepos.


## Practice Exercises

1. **Restructure:**
    - Take a medium-sized project and reorganize it into a feature-based structure. Notice how navigating and editing becomes easier.
2. **Add a Feature:**
    - Build a `/notifications` feature from scratch. Co-locate the UI, logic, tests, and styles.
3. **Index Export:**
    - Create an `index.js` file for your `/components` folder that re-exports all Button, Modal, and Card components.

## Project Idea

**Professional Scenario:**
Imagine you’re working in a five-person team on an e-commerce site.

- Reorganize to support parallel development (`/features/orders`, `/features/products`, `/features/users`).
- Document folder purpose with a short `README.md` in `/features`.
- Practice onboarding by pairing up and having someone else add a feature without confusion.

## Final Thoughts: Set the Stage for Growth \& Teamwork

**A well-organized codebase is an investment in your future self and your team.**
It turns onboarding from days into hours, and lets you add features without creating confusion.
Start simple, evolve as you go, and your projects will be ready for any scale-up moment.
