This page provides a robust test for the scientific formula rendering capabilities of the site, covering various complex notations across different subjects.

### Advanced Mathematics

Let's test some more advanced mathematical concepts.

The **Limit Definition of a Derivative** for a function $f(x)$ is a core concept in calculus:
$$ f'(x) = \lim\_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} $$

**Euler's Identity**, often cited as the most beautiful equation in mathematics, connects five fundamental constants:
$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$

We can also represent the **Binomial Theorem** using summation notation:
$$ (x+y)^n = \sum\_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k $$

And the **Standard Deviation** formula involves summation and square roots:
$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum\_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2} $$

### Advanced Physics

Here are some more formulas from various fields of physics.

The **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation** connects total energy $E$, rest mass $m_0$, and momentum $p$:
$$ E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 $$

**Coulomb's Law** in its vector form describes the electrostatic force $\mathbf{F}$ between two point charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$:
$$ \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} $$

The **Lorentz Transformation** for the time coordinate in special relativity is given by $\gamma$, the Lorentz factor:
$$ t' = \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right) \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} $$

### Advanced Chemistry (`mhchem`)

This section rigorously tests the `mhchem` extension for complex chemical notations.

A **redox reaction** in an acidic solution, like the oxidation of iron(II) by permanganate:
$$ \ce{MnO4- + 5Fe^2+ + 8H+ -> Mn^2+ + 5Fe^3+ + 4H2O} $$

Representing **chemical bonds** and structures:

- A triple bond: $\ce{A#B}$
- A single bond forward and a single bond back: $\ce{C ->[H2O] D}$

Writing **reaction mechanisms** with equilibrium:
$$ \ce{A <=>> B} $$

**Isotopes and Ions:**

- The isotope Carbon-14: $\ce{^{14}_{6}C}$
- The dichromate ion: $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$

**Gas-phase equilibrium** for the Haber process, including thermodynamic data:
$$ \ce{N2(g) + 3H2(g) <=> 2NH3(g)} \quad \Delta H = -92.4 \, \text{kJ/mol} $$

And representing a **complex organic reaction** like esterification:
$$ \ce{CH3COOH + CH3CH2OH <=> CH3COOCH2CH3 + H2O} $$
