## The Transition Elements (d-Block)

The d-block comprises elements from **Groups 3-12** where d orbitals are progressively filled. They are located in the **middle section** of the periodic table, flanked by s- and p-blocks.

### Definition of Transition Metals

Originally, the name "transition metals" indicated their chemical properties were transitional between s- and p-block elements. According to IUPAC, transition metals are defined as **metals which have an incomplete d subshell either in their neutral atom or in their ions**.

**Zinc ($\ce{Zn}$), Cadmium ($\ce{Cd}$), and Mercury ($\ce{Hg}$)** of Group 12 have a full $d^{10}$ configuration in their ground state and common oxidation states, and are therefore **not regarded as transition metals**. However, their chemistry is studied alongside transition metals as they are end members of the 3d, 4d, and 5d series.

### Series of Transition Metals

There are four series of transition metals:

- **3d series:** Scandium ($\ce{Sc}$) to Zinc ($\ce{Zn}$).
- **4d series:** Yttrium ($\ce{Y}$) to Cadmium ($\ce{Cd}$).
- **5d series:** Lanthanum ($\ce{La}$) and Hafnium ($\ce{Hf}$) to Mercury ($\ce{Hg}$).
- **6d series:** Actinium ($\ce{Ac}$) and elements from Rutherfordium ($\ce{Rf}$) to Copernicium ($\ce{Cn}$).

### Electronic Configurations of d-Block Elements

The general electronic configuration of the outer orbitals of d-block elements is **$(n-1)d^{1-10} ns^{1-2}$**.

- **Exception:** Palladium ($\ce{Pd}$) has an electronic configuration of $4d^{10} 5s^0$.
- **Anomalous configurations** like those of Chromium ($\ce{Cr}$) ($3d^5 4s^1$ instead of $3d^4 4s^2$) and Copper ($\ce{Cu}$) ($3d^{10} 4s^1$ instead of $3d^9 4s^2$) are due to the **relative stability of half-filled ($d^5$) and completely filled ($d^{10}$) d orbitals**.

### Characteristic Properties of Transition Elements

The presence of **partly filled d orbitals** is responsible for several characteristic properties:

- Display of a **variety of oxidation states**.
- Formation of **coloured ions**.
- Tendency for **complex formation** with various ligands.
- **Catalytic property**.
- **Paramagnetic behaviour**.
- Greater similarities in properties of elements in a horizontal row compared to non-transition elements.

### General Properties of the Transition Elements (d-Block)

#### Physical Properties

- Most transition elements display typical **metallic properties**: high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, high thermal and electrical conductivity, and metallic lustre.
- With exceptions of $\ce{Zn}$, $\ce{Cd}$, $\ce{Hg}$, and $\ce{Mn}$, they have typical metallic structures.
- They are generally **very hard** and have **low volatility**.
- They have **high melting and boiling points**. This is attributed to the involvement of a greater number of electrons from $(n-1)d$ orbitals in addition to $ns$ electrons in the **interatomic metallic bonding**.
     - Melting points typically rise to a maximum at $d^5$ configuration, except for $\ce{Mn}$ and $\ce{Tc}$.
- They possess **high enthalpies of atomisation**. The maxima in enthalpies of atomisation around the middle of each series (at $d^5$) indicate that **one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly favourable for strong interatomic interaction**.
- Metals of the second and third transition series generally have **greater enthalpies of atomisation** than corresponding elements of the first series. This is a factor in more frequent metal-metal bonding in heavier transition metal compounds.

#### Variation in Atomic and Ionic Sizes of Transition Metals

- Across a given series, atomic and ionic radii generally show a **progressive decrease** with increasing atomic number. This is due to the increase in nuclear charge and the **ineffective shielding effect of d electrons**.
- The radii of the **third (5d) series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second (4d) series**. This phenomenon is called **Lanthanoid contraction**.
     - It arises from the filling of 4f orbitals before the 5d series begins, causing a regular decrease in atomic radii that compensates for the expected increase in size.
     - The **imperfect shielding of one 4f electron by another** is less effective than that of one d electron by another.
     - Consequences: Zr (160 pm) and Hf (159 pm) have almost identical radii, leading to **very similar physical and chemical properties** and difficulty in their separation.
- A decrease in metallic radius coupled with an increase in atomic mass results in a **general increase in the density** of these elements.

#### Ionisation Enthalpies

- There is an **increase in ionisation enthalpy** along each series from left to right, primarily due to an **increase in nuclear charge**.
- The increase in successive ionisation enthalpies is **less steep** compared to non-transition elements.
- When d-block elements form ions, **$ns$ electrons are lost before $(n-1)d$ electrons**.
- Irregularities in ionisation enthalpies arise from the **relative stability of empty ($d^0$), half-filled ($d^5$), or completely filled ($d^{10}$) d orbitals**.
     - The second and third ionisation enthalpies show breaks at $\ce{Mn^{2+}}$ and $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$ respectively, both of which have a $d^5$ configuration.
     - The **lowest common oxidation state for these metals is +2**.
     - The second ionisation enthalpy for $\ce{Cr}$ and $\ce{Cu}$ is unusually high due to the stable $d^5$ and $d^{10}$ configurations of their $\ce{M+}$ ions.
     - The second ionisation enthalpy for $\ce{Zn}$ is low because ionisation removes a $4s$ electron, forming a stable $d^{10}$ configuration.
     - High third ionisation enthalpies for $\ce{Cu}$, $\ce{Ni}$, and $\ce{Zn}$ indicate the difficulty in obtaining oxidation states greater than +2 for these elements.

#### Oxidation States

- Transition elements exhibit a **great variety of oxidation states**.
- The elements showing the **greatest number of oxidation states occur in or near the middle of the series**, e.g., Manganese ($\ce{Mn}$) exhibits states from +2 to +7.
- Lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends:
     - **Scandium ($\ce{Sc}$), Titanium ($\ce{Ti}$)**: too few electrons to lose or share. Scandium (Z = 21) does not exhibit variable oxidation states.
     - **Copper ($\ce{Cu}$), Zinc ($\ce{Zn}$)**: too many d electrons, hence fewer orbitals available for sharing for higher valence. The only oxidation state of Zinc is +2.
- The variability of oxidation states in transition elements arises from incomplete filling of d orbitals, with oxidation states differing by **unity** (e.g., $\ce{V^{II}, V^{III}, V^{IV}, V^V}$). This contrasts with non-transition elements, where oxidation states normally differ by two.
- In d-block groups (4-10), **heavier members favour higher oxidation states** (opposite to the inert pair effect in p-block). For example, $\ce{Mo^{VI}}$ and $\ce{W^{VI}}$ are more stable than $\ce{Cr^{VI}}$.
- **Low oxidation states** (e.g., zero oxidation state in $\ce{Ni(CO)4}$ and $\ce{Fe(CO)5}$) are found when a complex compound has ligands with $\pi$-acceptor character.

#### Trends in Standard Electrode Potentials ($E^\circ$)

- **$\ce{M^{2+}/M}$ standard electrode potentials:**
     - The $\ce{E^\circ}$ value for **Copper ($\ce{Cu}$)** is **positive (+0.34 V)**, which accounts for its inability to liberate $\ce{H2}$ from acids. This is because the high energy to transform $\ce{Cu(s)}$ to $\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq)}$ is not balanced by its hydration enthalpy.
     - Generally, there is a trend towards **less negative $\ce{E^\circ}$ values** across the series, related to the increase in the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpies.
     - $\ce{Mn}$, $\ce{Ni}$, and $\ce{Zn}$ have $\ce{E^\circ}$ values more negative than expected. This is related to the stability of the half-filled $d^5$ subshell in $\ce{Mn^{2+}}$ and the completely filled $d^{10}$ configuration in $\ce{Zn^{2+}}$, and for $\ce{Ni}$, to its highest negative hydration enthalpy ($\Delta_{hyd}H^\circ$).
- **$\ce{M^{3+}/M^{2+}}$ standard electrode potentials:**
     - A low value for $\ce{Sc}$ reflects the **stability of $\ce{Sc^{3+}}$** (noble gas configuration).
     - A high value for $\ce{Zn}$ is due to the removal of an electron from the stable $d^{10}$ configuration of $\ce{Zn^{2+}}$.
     - A comparatively high value for $\ce{Mn}$ shows that $\ce{Mn^{2+}}$ ($d^5$) is **particularly stable**.
     - A comparatively low value for $\ce{Fe}$ shows the **extra stability of $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$** ($d^5$).
     - A comparatively low value for $\ce{V}$ is related to the stability of $\ce{V^{2+}}$ (half-filled $t_{2g}$ level).
     - $\ce{Cr^{2+}}$ is a **strong reducing agent** as its configuration changes from $d^4$ to $d^3$, with the latter having a stable half-filled $t_{2g}$ level.
       $$ \ce{2Cr^{2+}(aq) + 2H+(aq) -> 2Cr^{3+}(aq) + H2(g)} $$
     - $\ce{Mn^{3+}}$ is a **strong oxidising agent** as the change from $\ce{Mn^{3+}}$ to $\ce{Mn^{2+}}$ results in the stable half-filled $d^5$ configuration.

#### Trends in Stability of Higher Oxidation States

- The **highest oxidation numbers are achieved in fluorides and oxides**.
     - **Fluorine** stabilises the highest oxidation state due to high lattice energy (e.g., $\ce{CoF3}$) or high bond enthalpy terms for covalent compounds (e.g., $\ce{VF5}$ and $\ce{CrF6}$).
     - **Oxygen** is even more effective than fluorine at stabilising high oxidation states (e.g., $\ce{Mn2O7}$ vs $\ce{MnF4}$), attributed to its ability to form **multiple bonds** to metals.
- **Copper(I) compounds** are often unstable in aqueous solution and undergo **disproportionation** (where a particular oxidation state becomes less stable relative to a lower and higher oxidation state).
  $$ \ce{2Cu+ -> Cu^{2+} + Cu} $$
    The stability of $\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq)}$ over $\ce{Cu+(aq)}$ is due to the much more negative hydration enthalpy ($\Delta_{hyd}H^\circ$) of $\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq)}$.

#### Magnetic Properties

- Transition metal ions often exhibit **paramagnetism** due to the presence of **unpaired electrons**.
- The **magnetic moment ($\mu$)** for first series transition metals is primarily determined by the **number of unpaired electrons (n)** and can be calculated using the **'spin-only' formula**:
  $$ \mu = \sqrt{n(n+2)} \text{ BM} $$
  where BM is Bohr magnetons. A single unpaired electron has a magnetic moment of 1.73 BM.

#### Formation of Coloured Ions

- The colour of transition metal ions is attributed to **d-d transitions**. When an electron from a lower energy d orbital is excited to a higher energy d orbital, it **absorbs light from the visible region**. The observed colour is the **complementary colour** of the light absorbed.
- Ions with **empty ($d^0$) or completely filled ($d^{10}$) d orbitals are colourless** (e.g., $\ce{Sc^{3+}}$, $\ce{Ti^{4+}}$, $\ce{Zn^{2+}}$).

#### Formation of Complex Compounds

Transition metals form a large number of complex compounds due to:

- Comparatively **smaller sizes** of metal ions.
- **High ionic charges**.
- **Availability of d orbitals for bond formation**.

#### Catalytic Properties

- Transition metals and their compounds exhibit **catalytic activity**.
- This is ascribed to their ability to **adopt multiple oxidation states** and to **form complexes**.
- Examples include $\ce{V2O5}$ in the Contact Process, finely divided iron in the Haber Process, and nickel in Catalytic Hydrogenation.
- Catalysis involves the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and catalyst surface atoms, increasing reactant concentration and weakening bonds (lowering activation energy).

#### Formation of Interstitial Compounds

- Interstitial compounds are formed when small atoms like Hydrogen ($\ce{H}$), Carbon ($\ce{C}$), or Nitrogen ($\ce{N}$) are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals.
- They are usually **non-stoichiometric** and are neither typically ionic nor covalent.
- Characteristics: **high melting points**, **very hard**, retain **metallic conductivity**, and are **chemically inert**.

#### Alloy Formation

- Transition metals readily form **alloys** due to their **similar radii and other characteristics**.
- Alloys are typically hard and have high melting points.
- Examples include ferrous alloys (steels containing $\ce{Cr}$, $\ce{V}$, $\ce{W}$, $\ce{Mo}$, $\ce{Mn}$) and alloys with non-transition metals like brass ($\ce{Cu-Zn}$) and bronze ($\ce{Cu-Sn}$).

### Some Important Compounds of Transition Elements

#### Potassium Dichromate ($\ce{K2Cr2O7}$)

- Prepared from **chromite ore ($\ce{FeCr2O4}$)** by fusion with sodium or potassium carbonate in the presence of air.
  $$ \ce{4FeCr2O4 + 8Na2CO3 + 7O2 -> 8Na2CrO4 + 2Fe2O3 + 8CO2} $$
- The resulting yellow sodium chromate ($\ce{Na2CrO4}$) solution is acidified to form orange sodium dichromate ($\ce{Na2Cr2O7}$).
  $$ \ce{2Na2CrO4 + 2H+ -> Na2Cr2O7 + 2Na+ + H2O} $$
- Potassium dichromate is then crystallised by treating sodium dichromate solution with potassium chloride, as $\ce{K2Cr2O7}$ is less soluble.
  $$ \ce{Na2Cr2O7 + 2KCl -> K2Cr2O7 + 2NaCl} $$
- **Chromates ($\ce{CrO4^{2-}}$) and dichromates ($\ce{Cr2O7^{2-}}$) are interconvertible in aqueous solution depending on pH**.
     - In **acidic solution**, chromate converts to dichromate:
       $$ \ce{2CrO4^{2-} + 2H+ <=> Cr2O7^{2-} + H2O} $$
     - In **alkaline solution**, dichromate converts to chromate:
       $$ \ce{Cr2O7^{2-} + 2OH- <=> 2CrO4^{2-} + H2O} $$
- The chromium oxidation state is +6 in both.
- **Structure:** Chromate ion is tetrahedral. Dichromate ion consists of two tetrahedra sharing one corner, with a $\ce{Cr-O-Cr}$ bond angle of 126°.
- Potassium dichromate is a **strong oxidising agent** in acidic solutions.
  $$ \ce{Cr2O7^{2-} + 14H+ + 6e- -> 2Cr^{3+} + 7H2O} \quad (E^\circ = +1.33 \text{ V}) $$
- It oxidises iodides to iodine, sulphides to sulphur, tin(II) to tin(IV), and iron(II) salts to iron(III). Example with iron(II):
  $$ \ce{Cr2O7^{2-} + 14H+ + 6Fe^{2+} -> 2Cr^{3+} + 6Fe^{3+} + 7H2O} $$

#### Potassium Permanganate ($\ce{KMnO4}$)

- Prepared by fusion of Manganese Dioxide ($\ce{MnO2}$) with an alkali metal hydroxide ($\ce{KOH}$) and an oxidising agent ($\ce{KNO3}$), forming dark green Potassium Manganate ($\ce{K2MnO4}$).
  $$ \ce{2MnO2 + 4KOH + O2 -> 2K2MnO4 + 2H2O} $$
- The manganate then disproportionates in neutral or acidic solution to give permanganate.
  $$ \ce{3MnO4^{2-} + 4H+ -> 2MnO4- + MnO2 + 2H2O} $$
- Commercially, it's prepared by alkaline oxidative fusion of $\ce{MnO2}$ followed by electrolytic oxidation of manganate(VI).
- It forms **dark purple (almost black) crystals**.
- The green manganate ion ($\ce{MnO4^{2-}}$) is **paramagnetic** (one unpaired electron), while the purple permanganate ion ($\ce{MnO4-}$) is **diamagnetic** (absence of unpaired electrons). Both are tetrahedral.
- Acidified permanganate solution is a **strong oxidising agent**. The reduction potential depends on pH.
     - In **acid solutions**, permanganate is reduced to $\ce{Mn^{2+}}$ ($E^\circ = +1.52 \text{ V}$):
       $$ \ce{MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- -> Mn^{2+} + 4H2O} $$
     - It oxidises:
          - Iodides to iodine: $\ce{10I- + 2MnO4- + 16H+ -> 2Mn^{2+} + 8H2O + 5I2}$
          - $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ to $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$: $\ce{5Fe^{2+} + MnO4- + 8H+ -> Mn^{2+} + 4H2O + 5Fe^{3+}}$
          - Oxalate to carbon dioxide: $\ce{5C2O4^{2-} + 2MnO4- + 16H+ -> 2Mn^{2+} + 8H2O + 10CO2}$
          - Sulphurous acid/sulphite to sulphate: $\ce{5SO3^{2-} + 2MnO4- + 6H+ -> 2Mn^{2+} + 3H2O + 5SO4^{2-}}$
- In **neutral or faintly alkaline solutions**, permanganate is reduced to Manganese Dioxide ($\ce{MnO2}$).
  $$ \ce{MnO4- + 4H+ + 3e- -> MnO2 + 2H2O} \quad (E^\circ = +1.69 \text{ V}) $$
- **Uses:** Important oxidant in preparative organic chemistry, bleaching (wool, cotton, silk), and decolourisation of oils.

## The Inner Transition Elements (f-Block)

The f-block elements are placed in a separate panel at the bottom of the periodic table. They consist of two series:

- **Lanthanoids:** 4f series (Cerium ($\ce{Ce}$) to Lutetium ($\ce{Lu}$)). Lanthanum ($\ce{La}$) is usually included due to its resemblance.
- **Actinoids:** 5f series (Thorium ($\ce{Th}$) to Lawrencium ($\ce{Lr}$)). Actinium ($\ce{Ac}$) is usually included due to its resemblance.

### The Lanthanoids

- Lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than ordinary transition elements.
- They primarily exhibit **one stable oxidation state**.

#### Electronic Configurations

- Atoms of lanthanoids have a general configuration with $6s^2$ common, but with variable occupancy of the $4f$ level.
- The most stable oxidation state for all lanthanoids is **tripositive ($Ln^{3+}$) with an electronic configuration of $4f^n$** (where $n = 1$ to 14).

#### Atomic and Ionic Sizes: Lanthanoid Contraction

- There is an **overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from Lanthanum ($\ce{La}$) to Lutetium ($\ce{Lu}$)**. This unique feature is known as **Lanthanoid contraction**.
- It is caused by the **imperfect shielding of one 4f electron by another** as the nuclear charge increases across the series. The shielding of 4f electrons is less effective than that of d electrons.
- **Consequences of Lanthanoid Contraction:**
     - The radii of the members of the third transition series (5d) are very similar to those of the corresponding members of the second transition series (4d). For example, Zirconium ($\ce{Zr}$, 160 pm) and Hafnium ($\ce{Hf}$, 159 pm) have almost identical radii, leading to their co-occurrence in nature and difficulty in separation.

#### Oxidation States

- The **predominant oxidation state for lanthanoids is +3**.
- Occasionally, **+2 and +4 oxidation states** are also observed, primarily due to the extra stability of **empty ($f^0$), half-filled ($f^7$), or filled ($f^{14}$) f subshells**.
     - **Cerium ($\ce{Ce}$):** Can form $\ce{Ce^{IV}}$ ($4f^0$), which is a strong oxidant reverting to the common +3 state. Its $\ce{E^\circ}$ value for $\ce{Ce^{4+}/Ce^{3+}}$ is +1.74 V.
     - **Europium ($\ce{Eu}$):** Can form $\ce{Eu^{2+}}$ ($4f^7$) by losing two s electrons, making it a strong reducing agent.
     - **Ytterbium ($\ce{Yb}$):** Can form $\ce{Yb^{2+}}$ ($4f^{14}$), which is a reductant.
     - **Terbium ($\ce{Tb}$):** Can form $\ce{Tb^{IV}}$ ($4f^7$), which is an oxidant.

#### General Characteristics

- **Appearance:** Silvery white soft metals that tarnish rapidly in air.
- **Hardness:** Increases with increasing atomic number, with samarium ($\ce{Sm}$) being steel hard.
- **Melting Points:** Range from 1000 K to 1200 K, with $\ce{Sm}$ melting at 1623 K.
- **Conductivity:** Good conductors of heat and electricity.
- **Colour:** Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured due to the presence of f electrons. $\ce{La^{3+}}$ ($f^0$) and $\ce{Lu^{3+}}$ ($f^{14}$) ions are colourless.
- **Magnetism:** Lanthanoid ions (except $f^0$ and $f^{14}$ types) are **paramagnetic**.
- **Reactivity:** Earlier members of the series are quite reactive, similar to calcium. With increasing atomic number, they behave more like aluminium.
- **Chemical Reactions:**

     - Combine with hydrogen when gently heated.
     - Form carbides ($\ce{Ln3C, Ln2C3, LnC2}$) when heated with carbon.
     - Liberate hydrogen from dilute acids and burn in halogens to form halides ($\ce{LnX3}$).
     - Form oxides ($\ce{M2O3}$) and basic hydroxides ($\ce{M(OH)3}$).

- **Uses:**
     - Production of **alloy steels** for plates and pipes.
     - **Mischmetall:** An important alloy consisting of $\sim$95% lanthanoid metal and $\sim$5% iron, used in Mg-based alloys for bullets, shells, and lighter flints.
     - Mixed oxides are used as **catalysts in petroleum cracking**.
     - Some individual $\ce{Ln}$ oxides are used as **phosphors in television screens**.

### The Actinoids

- Actinoids include the fourteen elements from Thorium ($\ce{Th}$) to Lawrencium ($\ce{Lr}$).
- All actinoids are **radioactive elements**. The latter members have very short half-lives, making their study difficult.

#### Electronic Configurations

- All actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of $7s^2$ and variable occupancy of the $5f$ and $6d$ subshells.
- Irregularities in configurations are related to the stability of $f^0$, $f^7$, and $f^{14}$ occupancies of the $5f$ orbitals. For example, Americium ($\ce{Am}$) is $[Rn] 5f^7 7s^2$ and Curium ($\ce{Cm}$) is $[Rn] 5f^7 6d^1 7s^2$.
- The $5f$ orbitals are **not as buried as $4f$ orbitals**, meaning $5f$ electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.

#### Ionic Sizes: Actinoid Contraction

- There is a **gradual decrease in the size of atoms or $\ce{M^{3+}}$ ions across the series**, similar to lanthanoid contraction, called **actinoid contraction**.
- This contraction is **greater from element to element** than lanthanoid contraction, resulting from **poor shielding by $5f$ electrons**.

#### Oxidation States

- Actinoids exhibit a **greater range of oxidation states** compared to lanthanoids. This is attributed to the comparable energies of the $5f$, $6d$, and $7s$ levels.
- The **+3 oxidation state is common** for actinoids.
- Elements in the first half of the series frequently exhibit **higher oxidation states**:
     - Maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in $\ce{Th}$ to +5 in $\ce{Pa}$, +6 in $\ce{U}$, and +7 in $\ce{Np}$.
     - The maximum oxidation state then decreases in succeeding elements.

#### General Characteristics and Comparison with Lanthanoids

- **Appearance:** Silvery, but display a variety of structures due to greater irregularities in metallic radii than lanthanoids.
- **Reactivity:** Highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided. They react with boiling water and most non-metals at moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all of them.
- **Magnetic Properties:** More complex than lanthanoids, but variation roughly parallel.
- **Ionisation Enthalpies:** Lower for early actinoids than early lanthanoids. This is because $5f$ orbitals penetrate less into the inner core, making $5f$ electrons more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge and thus less firmly held and available for bonding.
- Lanthanoid-like behaviour is not evident until the second half of the actinoid series.
