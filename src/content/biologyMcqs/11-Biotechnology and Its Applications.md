              - "Rabies vaccine"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine, and if reliable, they could replace the use of monkeys for this purpose."

      - text: "For chemical safety (toxicity) testing, transgenic animals are engineered to be:"
        options:
              - "Resistant to toxic substances."
              - "Less sensitive to toxic substances."
              - "More sensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals, allowing faster results."
              - "Immune to all chemical interactions."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Transgenic animals are made to carry genes that make them more sensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals, allowing results to be obtained in less time during toxicity testing."

      - text: "A major ethical concern regarding the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the ecosystem is:"
        options:
              - "Their inability to reproduce in the wild."

              - "The unpredictable results and potential harm they might cause."
              - "Their short lifespan, making them ineffective in nature."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Genetic modification of organisms can have unpredictable results when such organisms are introduced into the ecosystem, which is a significant biological and ethical concern."

      - text: "What is the primary role of GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee) in India?"

              - "To regulate the international trade of all genetically modified products."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The Indian Government has set up organizations such as GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee) to make decisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of introducing GM-organisms for public services."

      - text: "The term 'biopiracy' is used to refer to:"
        options:
              - "The illegal trade of endangered species and their products."
              - "The use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organizations without proper authorization or compensatory payment."
              - "The development of new bio-resources through advanced genetic engineering."
              - "The conservation and protection of biodiversity in developing countries."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Biopiracy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by multinational companies and other organizations without proper authorization from the countries and people concerned without compensatory payment."

      - text: "In the context of patents and traditional knowledge, the sources state that:"
        options:
              - "Industrialized nations are generally rich in both finance and biodiversity."
              - "Developing and underdeveloped nations are rich in biodiversity and traditional knowledge."
              - "All nations have equal financial and bio-resource wealth."
              - "Traditional knowledge has no relevance for modern scientific applications."
