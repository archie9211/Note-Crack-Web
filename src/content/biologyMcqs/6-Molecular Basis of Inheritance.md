      - text: "Why can transcription and translation be coupled in bacteria?"
        options:
              - "Because mRNA requires processing"
              - "Because there is separation of cytosol and nucleus"
              - "Because mRNA does not require processing and there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus"
              - "Because ribosomes are absent"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become active, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same compartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria), many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully transcribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria [54, 55]."
