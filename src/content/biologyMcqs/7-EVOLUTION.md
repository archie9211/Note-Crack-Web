      - text: "Which of the following is NOT a connotation of the theory of special creation?"
        options:
              - "All living organisms were created as such."
              - "Diversity has always been the same and will be in the future."
              - "Earth is about 4000 years old."
              - "Life arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules."
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The theory of special creation implies that all species were created as such, diversity was constant, and Earth is about 4000 years old. The idea that life arose slowly from non-living molecules is abiogenesis, accepted by the majority, and contradicts special creation."

        correct: 2
        explanation: "The fitness, according to Darwin, refers ultimately and only to reproductive fitness, meaning those who are better fit in an environment leave more progeny than others."

      - text: "Which type of evidence for evolution involves the study of remains of hard parts of life-forms found in rocks?"

      - text: "Which of the following pairs is an example of analogous structures?"
        options:
              - "Vertebrate hearts and brains"
              - "Thorn of Bougainvillea and tendril of Cucurbita"
              - "Wings of butterfly and wings of birds"
              - "Forelimbs of human and cheetah"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Analogous structures perform similar functions but are not anatomically similar; they are a result of convergent evolution. The wings of a butterfly and a bird are a classic example."

      - text: "What phenomenon was observed in the population of moths in England after industrialisation?"
        options:
              - "Increase in white-winged moths due to cleaner environment."
              - "Decrease in dark-winged moths due to predators."
              - "Increase in dark-winged moths as they could camouflage against dark tree trunks."
              - "No change in moth population proportions."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "After industrialisation, tree trunks became dark due to industrial smoke. The dark-winged moths survived better due to camouflage, while white-winged moths were spotted by predators, leading to an increase in the proportion of dark-winged moths."

        options:
              - "Spontaneous generation"

              - "Genetic equilibrium"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The rapid appearance of resistant organisms/cells due to excess use of herbicides, pesticides, or antibiotics is an example of selection of resistant varieties, which is a form of evolution by anthropogenic (human) action."

              - "Hugo deVries"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Lamarck, a French naturalist, proposed that evolution was driven by the use and disuse of organs, exemplified by the elongation of giraffes' necks. This conjecture is no longer believed."

      - text: "According to Hugo deVries, what causes evolution?"
        options:
              - "Minor variations that are heritable"
              - "Gradual changes over long periods"
              - "Mutations, which are large differences arising suddenly"
              - "Natural selection of advantageous traits"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Hugo deVries believed that mutations, which are large differences arising suddenly in a population, cause evolution. He termed this 'saltation' (single step large mutation)."

      - text: "Which principle states that allele frequencies in a population are stable and constant from generation to generation in the absence of evolutionary influences?"
        options:
              - "Darwin's principle of natural selection"

              - "Lamarck's principle of acquired characteristics"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele frequencies in a population are stable and constant from generation to generation, representing genetic equilibrium."

      - text: "What is the algebraic representation of the Hardy-Weinberg equation for allele frequencies in a diploid population?"
        options:
              - "p + q = 1"
              - "p^2 + q^2 = 1"
              - "p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1"
              - "(p+q)^2 = p^2 + q^2"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The Hardy-Weinberg equation, representing the sum total of all allelic frequencies, is given by p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, which is a binomial expansion of (p+q)^2."

      - text: "Which of the following is NOT one of the five factors known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?"
        options:
              - "Gene migration"

              - "Sexual reproduction (random mating)"
              - "Mutation"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The five factors known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are gene migration or gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, genetic recombination, and natural selection. Sexual reproduction (random mating) is a condition for equilibrium, not a factor that disturbs it."

      - text: "What is the 'founder effect' in the context of genetic drift?"
        options:
              - "The increase in population size due to abundant resources."
              - "The establishment of a new population by a small number of individuals whose gene frequency is different from the original population."
              - "The process where a dominant allele becomes fixed in a population."
              - "The selective advantage gained by the first organisms to colonize a new habitat."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "When a change in allele frequency occurs by chance (genetic drift), and the change is so different in a new sample of population that they become a different species, the original drifted population becomes 'founders,' and the effect is called the founder effect."

              - "They were less intelligent in sensing danger."
              - "They were viviparous and protected their unborn young inside the mother’s body."
              - "They were larger in size than dinosaurs."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The first mammals were viviparous (giving birth to live young) and protected their unborn young inside the mother’s body. They were also more intelligent in sensing and avoiding danger."
