        options:
              - "Ecology"
              - "Physiology"
              - "Genetics"
              - "Biotechnology"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The subject of Genetics deals with the inheritance, as well as the variation of characters from parents to offspring."

      - text: "Who first applied statistical analysis and mathematical logic to problems in biology while investigating inheritance patterns?"
        options:
              - "James Watson"
              - "Francis Crick"
              - "Gregor Mendel"
              - "Thomas Hunt Morgan"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "During Mendelâ€™s investigations into inheritance patterns, it was for the first time that statistical analysis and mathematical logic were applied to problems in biology."

      - text: "A true-breeding line, as used by Mendel in his experiments, is characterized by:"
        options:
              - "Producing offspring with varied traits in each generation."
              - "Showing stable trait inheritance and expression for several generations after continuous self-pollination."
              - "Being the result of cross-pollination between two different varieties."
              - "Always exhibiting the recessive trait."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "A true-breeding line is one that, having undergone continuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and expression for several generations."

      - text: "In Mendel's monohybrid cross between true-breeding tall and dwarf pea plants, what was observed in the first hybrid generation (F1 progeny)?"
        options:
              - "All plants were dwarf."
              - "All plants were tall."
              - "Plants showed an intermediate height."
              - "Both tall and dwarf plants appeared in a 1:1 ratio."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Mendel observed that all the F1 progeny plants were tall, like one of its parents; none were dwarf."

      - text: "What was the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation of a Mendelian monohybrid cross?"
        options:
              - "1:2:1"
              - "3:1"
              - "9:3:3:1"
              - "1:1"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "In the F2 generation, 3/4th of the plants were tall while 1/4th were dwarf, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 3:1."

      - text: "Which of the following statements accurately describes 'factors' as proposed by Mendel?"
        options:
              - "They are unstable units that blend during inheritance."
              - "They are currently known as genes and are units of inheritance."
              - "They always express themselves whether homozygous or heterozygous."
              - "They are only found in dominant forms."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Mendel proposed that something was being stably passed down, unchanged, from parent to offspring through the gametes, over successive generations. He called these things as 'factors'. Now we call them as genes. Genes, therefore, are the units of inheritance."

      - text: "If 'TT' represents the genotype for a tall pea plant, and 'tall' is its phenotype, what would be the phenotype of a plant with genotype 'Tt' according to Mendel's observations on pea height?"
        options:
              - "Dwarf"
              - "Intermediate height"
              - "Tall"
              - "Cannot be determined"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "As Mendel found the phenotype of the F1 heterozygote Tt to be exactly like the TT parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar factors, one dominates the other (as in the F1) and hence is called the dominant factor."

      - text: "The Law of Segregation is based on which of the following facts regarding alleles during gamete formation?"
        options:
              - "Alleles blend completely."
              - "Both alleles are transmitted to every gamete."
              - "Alleles segregate from each other, and each gamete receives only one allele."
              - "Alleles are always expressed, regardless of their pairing."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "This law is based on the fact that the alleles do not show any blending and that both the characters are recovered as such in the F2 generation though one of these is not seen at the F1 stage. Though the parents contain two alleles during gamete formation, the factors or alleles of a pair segregate from each other such that a gamete receives only one of the two factors."

      - text: "What is the primary purpose of a test cross?"
        options:
              - "To determine the genotypic ratio of the F2 generation."
              - "To confirm the dominance of a trait."
              - "To determine the genotype of an organism showing a dominant phenotype."
              - "To obtain a true-breeding line."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "To determine the genotype of a tall plant at F2, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F2 with a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an organism showing a dominant phenotype (and whose genotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead of self-crossing."

      - text: "In snapdragon (Antirrhinum sp.) flowers, a cross between true-breeding red (RR) and white (rr) flowered plants produces F1 progeny with pink flowers. This phenomenon is an example of:"
        options:
              - "Co-dominance"
              - "Complete Dominance"
              - "Incomplete Dominance"
              - "Pleiotropy"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "When experiments on peas were repeated using other traits in other plants, it was found that sometimes the F1 had a phenotype that did not resemble either of the two parents and was in between the two. The inheritance of flower colour in the dog flower (snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example to understand incomplete dominance."

      - text: "ABO blood grouping in humans is a classic example of:"
        options:
              - "Incomplete dominance"
              - "Multiple alleles"
              - "Co-dominance"
              - "Both B and C"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "ABO blood groups are controlled by the gene I, which has three alleles IA, IB and i. The alleles IA and IB are completely dominant over i, but when IA and IB are present together they both express their own types of sugars, which is co-dominance. Since there are more than two alleles, it also provides a good example of multiple alleles."

      - text: "According to the sources, a recessive trait is seen because the modified allele typically produces:"
        options:
              - "A more efficient enzyme."
              - "A non-functional enzyme or no enzyme."
              - "The same phenotype as the unmodified allele."
              - "An enzyme that enhances the substrate transformation."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents the original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is generally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait is seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced."

      - text: "Which of the following human diseases is given as an example of pleiotropy, where a single gene mutation results in multiple phenotypic expressions like mental retardation and reduced hair/skin pigmentation?"
        options:
              - "Sickle-cell anaemia"
              - "Haemophilia"
              - "Thalassemia"
              - "Phenylketonuria"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "An example of pleiotropy is the disease phenylketonuria, which occurs in humans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase. This manifests itself through phenotypic expression characterised by mental retardation and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation."

      - text: "In Mendel's dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation was:"
        options:
              - "1:2:1"
              - "3:1"
              - "9:3:3:1"
              - "1:1:1:1"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In the dihybrid cross, the phenotypes round, yellow; wrinkled, yellow; round, green and wrinkled, green appeared in the ratio 9:3:3:1."

      - text: "Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment states that:"
        options:
              - "Factors blend in the F1 generation."
              - "When two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters."
              - "Dominant traits always mask recessive traits."
              - "Each gamete receives two alleles for each gene."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The law states that 'when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair of characters is independent of the other pair of characters'."

      - text: "Which of the following was NOT a reason for Mendel's work remaining unrecognised until 1900?"
        options:
              - "Lack of easy communication at the time."
              - "His concept of discrete units not accepted due to continuous variation."
              - "His use of mathematics in biology was novel and unacceptable."
              - "He failed to provide any experimental evidence for his laws."
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Mendel's work was unrecognised until 1900 due to poor communication, his concept of genes as stable and discrete units was not accepted due to apparent continuous variation, and his mathematical approach was new and unacceptable to biologists. While he could not provide physical proof for 'factors', his inferences were confirmed by experiments on successive generations, indicating strong experimental evidence for his results."

      - text: "The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was proposed by:"
        options:
              - "James Watson and Francis Crick"
              - "Gregor Mendel"
              - "Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri"
              - "Thomas Hunt Morgan"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of chromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used chromosome movement to explain Mendelâ€™s laws. Sutton united the knowledge of chromosomal segregation with Mendelian principles and called it the chromosomal theory of inheritance."

      - text: "Which of the following is NOT an advantage of using Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) for genetic studies?"
        options:
              - "They have a long life cycle, allowing for observation of many generations."
              - "They can be grown on simple synthetic medium in the laboratory."
              - "A single mating produces a large number of progeny flies."
              - "There is a clear differentiation of sexes."
        correct: 0
        explanation: "Drosophila melanogaster is suitable because they complete their life cycle in about two weeks (a short life cycle), not a long one. They also can be grown on simple medium, produce large progeny, and have clear sex differentiation."

      - text: "The term 'linkage' describes the physical association of genes on a chromosome, while 'recombination' describes:"
        options:
              - "The blending of parental traits."
              - "The independent assortment of all genes."
              - "The generation of non-parental gene combinations."
              - "The process of gamete formation."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Morgan coined the term linkage to describe this physical association of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations."

      - text: "Who used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and 'mapped' their position on the chromosome?"
        options:
              - "T.H. Morgan"
              - "Alfred Sturtevant"
              - "Gregor Mendel"
              - "Walter Sutton"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Morgan's student Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and 'mapped' their position on the chromosome."

      - text: "Which characteristic is true for polygenic traits?"
        options:
              - "They are controlled by a single gene."
              - "Their phenotype reflects the additive contribution of each allele."
              - "They show distinct alternate forms, like tall or dwarf."
              - "Environmental factors have no influence on their expression."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the contribution of each allele, i.e., the effect of each allele is additive."

      - text: "In human sex determination, what determines the sex of the child?"
        options:
              - "The mother's ovum, as it carries either an X or a Y chromosome."
              - "The father's sperm, as it carries either an X or a Y chromosome."
              - "The number of autosomes present in the zygote."
              - "Environmental factors during gestation."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "During spermatogenesis among males, two types of gametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry the X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome. Females produce only one type of ovum with an X-chromosome. Thus, it is evident that it is the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child."

      - text: "In the haplodiploid sex-determination system of honey bees:"
        options:
              - "Males are diploid and females are haploid."
              - "Fertilized eggs develop into males."
              - "Unfertilised eggs develop into males through parthenogenesis."
              - "Males have a father but no sons."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female, and an unfertilised egg develops as a male (drone) by means of parthenogenesis. Males are haploid (16 chromosomes) while females are diploid (32 chromosomes)."

      - text: "A change in a single base pair of DNA is known as a:"
        options:
              - "Chromosomal aberration"
              - "Frame-shift mutation"
              - "Point mutation"
              - "Deletion"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Mutation also arises due to change in a single base pair of DNA. This is known as point mutation. A classical example of such a mutation is sickle cell anemia."

      - text: "Which of the following is an example of an X-linked recessive Mendelian disorder characterized by non-stop bleeding from a simple cut?"
        options:
              - "Sickle-cell anaemia"
              - "Phenylketonuria"
              - "Thalassemia"
              - "Haemophilia"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Haemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disease. In this disease, a single protein that is a part of the cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to this, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding."

      - text: "The defect in sickle-cell anaemia is primarily caused by:"
        options:
              - "A chromosomal deletion."
              - "An extra copy of chromosome 21."
              - "Substitution of Glutamic acid by Valine in the beta globin chain due to a single base substitution."
              - "Reduced synthesis of globin chains."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid (Glu) by Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the haemoglobin molecule. The substitution of amino acid in the globin protein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of the beta globin gene from GAG to GUG."

      - text: "How does Thalassemia primarily differ from Sickle-cell anaemia?"
        options:
              - "Thalassemia is a qualitative problem of incorrectly functioning globin, while sickle-cell is quantitative."
              - "Thalassemia is an autosome-linked dominant trait, while sickle-cell is recessive."
              - "Thalassemia is a quantitative problem of synthesising too few globin molecules, while sickle-cell is a qualitative problem."
              - "Thalassemia only affects alpha globin chains, while sickle-cell affects beta globin chains."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell anaemia in that the former is a quantitative problem of synthesising too few globin molecules while the latter is a qualitative problem of synthesising an incorrectly functioning globin."

      - text: "Down's Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder resulting from:"
        options:
              - "Absence of an X chromosome."
              - "An additional copy of chromosome 21."
              - "Presence of an additional X-chromosome (XXY)."
              - "Loss of a segment of DNA."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The cause of this genetic disorder is the presence of an additional copy of the chromosome number 21 (trisomy of 21)."

      - text: "An individual with Klinefelter's Syndrome typically has a karyotype of:"
        options:
              - "45, X0"
              - "47, XXY"
              - "47, +21"
              - "46, XY"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "Klinefelterâ€™s Syndrome is caused due to the presence of an additional copy of X-chromosome resulting into a karyotype of 47, XXY."

      - text: "Which of the following characteristics is associated with Turner's Syndrome?"
        options:
              - "Overall masculine development with gynaecomastia."
              - "Short stature, furrowed tongue, mental retardation."
              - "Sterile females with rudimentary ovaries and lack of secondary sexual characters."
              - "Normal male characteristics with impaired clotting."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Turnerâ€™s Syndrome is caused due to the absence of one of the X chromosomes, i.e., 45 with X0. Such females are sterile as ovaries are rudimentary besides other features including lack of other secondary sexual characters."

      - text: "A normal human cell contains how many pairs of chromosomes?"
        options:
              - "22"
              - "23"
              - "46"
              - "47"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The total number of chromosomes in a normal human cell is 46 (23 pairs)."

      - text: "The phenomenon where an organism has an increase in a whole set of chromosomes, often seen in plants due to failure of cytokinesis after telophase, is known as:"
        options:
              - "Aneuploidy"
              - "Trisomy"
              - "Monosomy"
              - "Polyploidy"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "Failure of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division results in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and, this phenomenon is known as polyploidy. This condition is often seen in plants."

      - text: "Colour blindness occurs in about 8% of males but only about 0.4% of females. This difference is primarily because:"
        options:
              - "Males are more exposed to environmental mutagens."
              - "The genes for colour blindness are on the Y chromosome."
              - "The genes for colour blindness are on the X chromosome, and males have only one X."
              - "Females have a stronger immune system against genetic defects."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "This defect is due to mutation in certain genes present in the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome and females have two. The mother is not herself colour blind because the gene is recessive, and its effect is suppressed by her matching dominant normal gene."

      - text: "In the haplodiploid sex-determination system, males produce sperms by:"
        options:
              - "Meiosis"
              - "Mitosis"
              - "Fertilization"
              - "Parthenogenesis"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "In the haplodiploid sex-determination system, the males produce sperms by mitosis."

      - text: "Humans knew about variation and exploited it through selective breeding as early as:"
        options:
              - "Mid-nineteenth century"
              - "1900"
              - "8000-1000 B.C."
              - "1953"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Humans knew from as early as 8000-1000 B.C. that one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual reproduction. They exploited the variations that were naturally present in the wild populations of plants and animals to selectively breed and select for organisms that possessed desirable characters."

      - text: "A heterozygous individual (e.g., Tt for tall height) produces gametes containing the alleles T and t in what proportion?"
        options:
              - "1:3"
              - "3:1"
              - "1:1"
              - "2:1"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "When the tall and dwarf plant produce gametes, by the process of meiosis, the alleles of the parental pair separate or segregate from each other and only one allele is transmitted to a gamete. This segregation of alleles is a random process and so there is a 50 per cent chance of a gamete containing either allele. The F1 plant of the genotype Tt when self-pollinated, produces gametes of the genotype T and t in equal proportion."

      - text: "Which of Mendel's observations refuted the idea of 'blending inheritance'?"
        options:
              - "The 9:3:3:1 ratio in dihybrid crosses."
              - "The fact that all F1 progeny in a monohybrid cross resembled one parent."
              - "The reappearance of the recessive trait in the F2 generation without any intermediate forms."
              - "The Law of Independent Assortment."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The tall and dwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any blending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of in-between height. Similarly, the contrasting traits did not show any blending at either F1 or F2 stage."

      - text: "The ABO blood grouping system in humans is an example of multiple alleles because:"
        options:
              - "It involves two genes."
              - "It shows incomplete dominance."
              - "There are more than two alleles governing the same character in the population."
              - "Both IA and IB are completely dominant over i."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The example of ABO blood grouping also provides a good example of multiple alleles. Here you can see that there are more than two, i.e., three alleles (IA, IB, and i), governing the same character."

      - text: "When a single gene product produces more than one effect, such a gene is called a:"
        options:
              - "Polygenic gene"
              - "Linked gene"
              - "Pleiotropic gene"
              - "Recessive gene"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "There are however instances where a single gene can exhibit multiple phenotypic expression. Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene."

      - text: "In many birds, the sex determination mechanism is of the ZW type. Which statement is correct regarding their sex chromosomes?"
        options:
              - "Males are ZW and females are ZZ."
              - "Males are ZZ and females are ZW."
              - "Both males and females are ZW."
              - "Both males and females are ZZ."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "In birds, the females have one Z and one W chromosome, whereas males have a pair of Z-chromosomes besides the autosomes."

      - text: "What two phenomena are mentioned as leading to variation in DNA?"
        options:
              - "Hybridization and self-pollination."
              - "Dominance and recessiveness."
              - "Recombination and mutation."
              - "Segregation and independent assortment."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Mutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences and consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype of an organism. In addition to recombination, mutation is another phenomenon that leads to variation in DNA."

      - text: "A female can rarely be haemophilic because:"
        options:
              - "The gene is on the autosomes."
              - "She would need to inherit the recessive gene from only one parent."
              - "Her mother has to be at least a carrier and her father should be haemophilic (which is often unviable in the later stage of life)."
              - "Haemophilia primarily affects females."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely rare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the father should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life)."

      - text: "In human genetics, pedigree study serves as a strong tool to:"
        options:
              - "Conduct controlled crosses on human subjects."
              - "Trace the inheritance of specific traits, abnormalities, or diseases over generations."
              - "Artificially select desirable traits in offspring."
              - "Determine the exact number of chromosomes in an individual."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "In human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is utilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease."

      - text: "Which of the following is an autosomal recessive disorder?"
        options:
              - "Haemophilia"
              - "Colour blindness"
              - "Sickle-cell anaemia"
              - "Klinefelter's Syndrome"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "Sickle-cell anaemia is an autosome linked recessive trait. Haemophilia and Colour blindness are sex-linked recessive disorders. Klinefelter's Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder."
