              - "It does not occur in plant cells; only nuclear division happens."
              - "Wall formation starts in the centre of the cell with a cell-plate and grows outward."
              - "The cytoplasm divides by budding off small vesicles."
        correct: 2
        explanation: "In an animal cell, cytokinesis is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma membrane. Plant cells however, are enclosed by a relatively inextensible cell wall, therefore they undergo cytokinesis by a different mechanism.
