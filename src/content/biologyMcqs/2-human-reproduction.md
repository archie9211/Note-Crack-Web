              - "Luteal phase"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual flow results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels."

      - text: "Menstruation occurs only if:"
        options:
              - "Ovulation takes place"

              - "Regenerates through proliferation"
              - "Transforms into corpus luteum"
        correct: 2
        explanation: "During this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a fully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium of uterus regenerates through proliferation."

      - text: "The rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle (about 14th day) is called:"

        correct: 2
        explanation: "Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle (about 14th day). Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum (ovulation)."

              - "LH"
              - "Progesterone"
        correct: 3
        explanation: "The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium. Such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy."

              - "Sperms are immediately expelled."
        correct: 1
        explanation: "During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with the zona pellucida layer of the ovum and induces changes in the membrane that block the entry of additional sperms. Thus, it ensures that only one sperm can fertilise an ovum."

      - text: "The entry of the sperm into the cytoplasm of the ovum induces the completion of which meiotic division of the secondary oocyte?"
        options:
              - "First meiotic division"
              - "Second meiotic division"
              - "Mitotic division"
              - "Does not induce any division"
        correct: 1

              - "Number of polar bodies formed"
        correct: 1
        explanation: "The zygote would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female baby and XY would form a male. That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!."

      - text: "The zygote undergoes repeated mitotic divisions as it moves through the isthmus of the oviduct. The embryo with 8 to 16 blastomeres is called a:"
